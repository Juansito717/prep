<div class="para">Because we know the values of the cosine and sine functions from the unit circle, right triangles with hypotentuse <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> are the easiest ones in which to determine missing information.  In addition, we can relate any other right triangle to a right triangle with hypotenuse <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> through the concept of <em class="emphasis">similarity</em>.  Recall that two triangles are <dfn class="terminology">similar</dfn>  provided that one is a magnification of the other.  More precisely, two triangles are similar whenever there is some constant <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> such that every side in one triangle is <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> times as long as the corresponding side in the other and the corresponding angles in the two triangles are equal.  An important result from geometry tells us that if two triangles are known to have all three of their corresponding angles equal, then it follows that the two triangles are similar, and therefore their corresponding sides must be proportionate to one another.</div>
