<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = k(x-1)(x-a)(x-b)\text{,}\)</span> we immediately know that <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a degree <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> polynomial with <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> real zeros:  <span class="process-math">\(x = 1, a, b\text{.}\)</span>  We are given that <span class="process-math">\(1 \lt a \lt b\)</span> and in addition that <span class="process-math">\(k \lt 0\text{.}\)</span>  If we expand the factored form of <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\text{,}\)</span> it has form <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = kx^3 + \cdots\text{,}\)</span> and since we know that when we zoom out, <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> behaves like <span class="process-math">\(kx^3\text{,}\)</span> we know that with <span class="process-math">\(k \lt 0\)</span> it follows <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = +\infty\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to \infty} p(x) = -\infty\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is degree <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and we know it has zeros at <span class="process-math">\(x = 1, a, b,\)</span> we know there are no other locations where <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span>  Thus, on any interval between two zeros (or to the left of the least or the right of the greatest), the polynomial cannot change sign.  We now investigate, interval by interval, the sign of the function.</div> <div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(x - 1 \lt 0\text{.}\)</span>  In addition, since <span class="process-math">\(1 \lt a \lt b\text{,}\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> lies to the left of <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> which also makes <span class="process-math">\(x-a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x-b\)</span> negative.  Moreover, we know that the constant <span class="process-math">\(k \lt 0\text{.}\)</span>  Hence, on the interval <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> all four terms in <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = k(x-1)(x-a)(x-b)\)</span> are negative, which we indicate by writing “<span class="process-math">\(----\)</span>” in that location on the sign chart pictured in <a href="sec-poly-polynomials.html#F-polynomial-sign-chart-1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/F-polynomial-sign-chart-1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 5.2.6">Figure 5.2.6</a>.</div> <div class="para">In addition, since there are an even number of negative terms in the product, the overall product’s sign is positive, which we indicate by the single “<span class="process-math">\(+\)</span>” beneath “<span class="process-math">\(----\)</span>”, and by writing “POS” below the coordinate axis.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/images/polynomial-sign-chart-1.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>

On <span class="process-math">\(1 \lt x \lt a\text{,}\)</span> the term <span class="process-math">\((x-1)\)</span> has become positive, since <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 1\text{.}\)</span>  But both <span class="process-math">\(x-a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x-b\)</span> are negative, as is the constant <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> and thus we write “<span class="process-math">\(-+--\)</span>” for this interval, which has overall sign “<span class="process-math">\(-\)</span>”, as noted in the figure.
