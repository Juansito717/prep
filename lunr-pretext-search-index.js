  "title": "Nuestros Objetivos",
  "body": " Nuestros Objetivos  Este texto está diseñado para estudiantes universitarios que aspiran a tomar cálculo y que necesitan tomar un curso para prepararse para cálculo o desean hacer un estudio adicional por su cuenta. Muchos de los temas centrales del curso serán familiares para los estudiantes que han completado la escuela secundaria. Al mismo tiempo, tomamos una perspectiva sobre cada tema que enfatiza su importancia en el cálculo. Este texto está escrito en el espíritu de Active Calculus y es especialmente ideal para los estudiantes que eventualmente estudiarán cálculo con ese texto. El lector encontrará que el texto requiere que se involucre activamente con el material, que vea los temas desde múltiples perspectivas y que desarrolle una comprensión conceptual profunda de las ideas.  Muchos cursos a nivel de escuela secundaria y universidad con títulos como álgebra universitaria , precálculo y trigonometría sirven a otras disciplinas y cursos distintos al cálculo. Como tal, estas clases frecuentemente contienen material variado que, aunque matemáticamente interesante e importante, no es necesario para el cálculo. Tal vez debido a estos temas adicionales, ciertas ideas que son esenciales en cálculo están subestimadas o ignoradas. En Preludio Activo al Cálculo , uno de nuestros principales objetivos es mantener el enfoque en las siguientes ideas más importantes.      Funciones como procesos . El concepto matemático de función es sofisticado. Comprender cómo una función es un proceso matemático especial que convierte una colección de entradas en una colección de salidas es crucial para el éxito en cálculo, ya que el cálculo es el estudio de cómo cambian las funciones.     Tasa de cambio promedio . La idea central en el cálculo diferencial es la tasa de cambio instantánea de una función, que mide qué tan rápido cambia la salida de una función con respecto a los cambios en la entrada en una ubicación particular. Dado que la tasa de cambio instantánea se define en términos de la tasa de cambio promedio, es esencial que los estudiantes se sientan cómodos y familiarizados con la idea, el significado y las aplicaciones de la tasa de cambio promedio.     Biblioteca de funciones básicas . La gran mayoría de las funciones en cálculo provienen de una combinación algebraica de una colección de funciones básicas familiares que incluyen funciones de potencia, circulares, exponenciales y logarítmicas. Al desarrollar la comprensión de una familia relativamente pequeña de funciones básicas y usar estas junto con transformaciones para considerar colecciones más grandes de funciones, trabajamos para hacer que los objetos centrales del cálculo sean más intuitivos y accesibles.     Familias de funciones que modelan fenómenos importantes . Las matemáticas son el lenguaje de la ciencia, y es notable lo efectivas que son las matemáticas para representar fenómenos físicos observables. Desde funciones cuadráticas que modelan cómo un objeto cae bajo la influencia de la gravedad, hasta funciones exponenciales desplazadas que modelan cómo se enfría el café, pasando por funciones sinusoidales que modelan cómo oscila un sistema de masa-resorte, las funciones básicas familiares encuentran muchas aplicaciones importantes en el mundo que nos rodea. Utilizamos regularmente estas situaciones físicas para ayudarnos a ver la importancia de las funciones y a entender cómo se necesitan familias de funciones que dependen de diferentes parámetros para representar estas situaciones.     El seno y el coseno son funciones circulares . Muchos estudiantes son introducidos por primera vez a las funciones seno y coseno a través de triángulos rectángulos. Aunque esta perspectiva es importante, es más importante en cálculo y otros cursos avanzados entender cómo las funciones seno y coseno surgen de un punto que recorre una circunferencia. Adoptamos esta perspectiva de funciones circulares desde el principio para desarrollar una comprensión profunda de cómo se generan las conocidas ondas de seno y coseno.     Inversas de funciones . Cuando una función tiene una función inversa, la función inversa nos brinda la oportunidad de ver una idea desde una nueva perspectiva. Las inversas también juegan un papel crucial en la resolución de ecuaciones algebraicas y en la determinación de parámetros desconocidos en modelos. Enfatizamos la perspectiva de que una función inversa es un proceso que invierte el proceso de la función original, así como las importantes funciones básicas que surgen como inversas de otras funciones, especialmente los logaritmos y las funciones trigonométricas inversas.     Valores exactos versus aproximados . La capacidad de representar números exactamente es una herramienta poderosa en matemáticas. Regularmente y de manera consistente distinguimos entre el valor exacto de un número, como , y su aproximación, digamos . Esta idea también está estrechamente relacionada con las funciones y la notación funcional: , y son todas representaciones simbólicas de números exactos que solo pueden ser aproximados por una computadora.     Encontrar fórmulas de funciones en contextos aplicados . En contextos aplicados con variables desconocidas, es especialmente útil poder representar relaciones entre variables, ya que tales relaciones a menudo conducen a funciones cuyo comportamiento podemos estudiar. Trabajamos a lo largo de Preludio Activo al Cálculo para preparar a los estudiantes para problemas en cálculo que les piden desarrollar fórmulas de funciones mediante la observación de relaciones.     Tendencias a largo plazo, comportamiento ilimitado y límites . Al trabajar para estudiar las funciones como objetos en sí mismos, a menudo nos centramos en las tendencias y el comportamiento general. Además de introducir las ideas de una función que crece o decrece, o que es cóncava hacia arriba o hacia abajo, también nos enfocamos en utilizar enfoques algebraicos para comprender el comportamiento de las funciones cuando la entrada y\/o la salida aumentan sin límite. En anticipación al cálculo, usamos la notación de límites y trabajamos para entender cómo esta abreviatura resume características clave de las funciones.     "

  "title": "Características del Texto",
  "body": " Características del Texto  Tanto los instructores como los estudiantes encontrarán varias características consistentes en la presentación, incluyendo:   Preguntas Motivadoras  Al inicio de cada sección, enumeramos 2 3 preguntas motivadoras que proporcionan la motivación de por qué el material siguiente es de nuestro interés. Uno de los objetivos de cada sección es responder a cada una de las preguntas motivadoras.    Actividades de Preparación  Cada sección del texto comienza con una breve introducción, seguida de una actividad de preparación . Esta breve lectura y actividad de preparación están diseñadas para anticipar las ideas que se presentarán en el resto de la sección; tanto la lectura como la actividad de preparación están destinadas a ser accesibles para los estudiantes con antelación a la clase, y de hecho deben ser completadas por los estudiantes antes de que la sección particular sea considerada en clase.    Actividades  Una sección típica del texto tiene al menos tres actividades . Estas están diseñadas para involucrar a los estudiantes en un estilo basado en la indagación que los anima a construir soluciones a ejemplos clave por sí mismos, trabajando en pequeños grupos o individualmente.    Ejercicios  Existen docenas de textos de álgebra universitaria y trigonometría con (colectivamente) decenas de miles de ejercicios. En lugar de repetir ejercicios estándar y rutinarios en este texto, recomendamos el uso de WeBWorK con su acceso a la Open Problem Library (OPL) y sus muchos miles de problemas relevantes. En este texto, cada sección incluye una pequeña colección de ejercicios anónimos de WeBWorK que ofrecen a los estudiantes retroalimentación inmediata sin penalización, así como 3 4 ejercicios adicionales desafiantes por sección. Cada uno de los ejercicios que no son de WeBWorK tiene múltiples partes, requiere que el estudiante conecte varias ideas clave y espera que el estudiante haga al menos una cantidad modesta de escritura para responder las preguntas y explicar sus hallazgos.    Gráficos  En la medida de lo posible, nos esforzamos por demostrar visualmente las ideas fundamentales clave y por animar a los estudiantes a hacer lo mismo. A lo largo del texto, utilizamos gráficos en color Para mantener el costo bajo, los gráficos en la versión de impresión bajo demanda están en blanco y negro. Cuando el texto mismo se refiere a colores en las imágenes, es necesario ver el .html o .pdf electrónicamente. para ejemplificar y magnificar ideas clave, y para usar esta perspectiva gráfica junto con representaciones numéricas y algebraicas del cálculo.    Gráficos interactivos  Muchas de las ideas sobre cómo se comportan las funciones se entienden mejor de manera dinámica; los applets ofrecen un formato a menudo ideal para investigaciones y demostraciones. Desmos proporciona una utilidad de graficación en línea gratuita y fácil de usar a la que ocasionalmente enlazamos y a menudo dirigimos a los estudiantes a usar. Gracias a David Austin, también hay figuras interactivas en javascript dentro del propio texto.    Resumen de Ideas Clave  Cada sección concluye con un resumen de las ideas clave encontradas en la sección anterior; este resumen normalmente refleja las respuestas a las preguntas motivadoras que iniciaron la sección.

  "body": " Estudiantes! Lean esto!  Este libro es diferente.  El texto está disponible en dos formatos diferentes: HTML y PDF, cada uno está disponible a través de enlaces en la página de inicio en https:\/\/activecalculus.org\/ . Los dos formatos son gratuitos. Si vas a usar el libro electrónicamente, el mejor modo es el HTML . La versión HTML se ve genial en cualquier navegador, incluyendo en un smartphone, y los enlaces son mucho más fáciles de navegar en HTML que en PDF. Algunas sugerencias directas sobre el uso del HTML se encuentran en los siguientes párrafos; alternativamente, puedes ver este breve video del autor (basado en el uso del texto Active Calculus , que es similar). También es prudente descargar y guardar el PDF, ya que puedes usar el PDF sin conexión, mientras que la versión HTML requiere una conexión a Internet. Una copia impresa (en inglés) económica está disponible en Amazon .  Este libro está destinado a ser leído secuencialmente y a ser utilizado de manera interactiva, más que como una referencia de consulta. Por ejemplo, cada sección comienza con una breve introducción y una Actividad de Preparación; deberías leer la breve introducción y completar la Actividad de Preparación antes de la clase. Tu instructor podría solicitar que hagas esto. La mayoría de las Actividades de Preparación pueden completarse en 15-20 minutos y están destinadas a ser accesibles en base a la comprensión que tiene de las secciones anteriores.  Al usar el libro, piensa en él como un libro para hacer, no un libro hecho. Hay una gran cantidad de estudios que muestran que las personas aprenden mejor cuando se involucran de manera interactiva y abordan las ideas por su cuenta, en lugar de observar pasivamente a otros. Por lo tanto, en lugar de leer ejemplos resueltos o ver a un instructor completar ejemplos, te involucrarás con Actividades que te invitan a lidiar con conceptos y desarrollar una comprensión profunda. Debes esperar pasar tiempo en clase trabajando con compañeros en Actividades y recibiendo retroalimentación de ellos y de tu instructor. Puedes pedirle a tu instructor una copia del archivo PDF que solo tiene las actividades junto con espacio para registrar tu trabajo. Tu objetivo debe ser hacer todas las actividades en las secciones relevantes del texto y llevar un registro cuidadoso de tu trabajo.  Cada sección concluye con un Resumen. Leer el Resumen después de haber leído la sección y trabajado en las Actividades es una buena manera de encontrar una lista breve de ideas clave para llevarse de la sección. Un buen hábito de estudio es escribir resúmenes similares con tus propias palabras.  Al final de cada sección, encontrarás dos tipos de Ejercicios. Primero, hay varios ejercicios anónimos de WeBWorK . Estos son ejercicios en línea, interactivos, que te permiten enviar respuestas para recibir retroalimentación inmediata con intentos ilimitados sin penalización; para enviar respuestas, debes estar usando la versión HTML del texto (ver este breve video sobre la versión HTML que incluye una demostración de WeBWorK ). Debes usar estos ejercicios como una forma de probar tu comprensión de las ideas básicas en la sección anterior. Si tu institución utiliza WeBWorK , es posible que también necesites iniciar sesión en un servidor según las indicaciones de tu instructor para completar conjuntos de WeBWorK asignados como parte de tu calificación del curso. Los ejercicios de WeBWorK incluidos en este texto no tienen calificación y no están conectados a ninguna cuenta individual. Después de los ejercicios de WeBWorK , hay 3-4 ejercicios desafiantes adicionales que están diseñados para animarte a conectar ideas, investigar nuevas situaciones y escribir sobre tu comprensión.   La mejor manera de tener éxito en matemáticas en general y en cálculo en particular es esforzarse por comprender las ideas principales. Entendemos las ideas haciendo preguntas, interactuando con otros, intentando resolver problemas, cometiendo errores, revisando intentos y escribiendo y hablando sobre nuestra comprensión. Este texto ha sido diseñado para ayudarte a comprender las ideas clave que se necesitan en cálculo y para ayudarte a estar bien preparado para tener éxito en cálculo; te deseamos lo mejor mientras emprendes la gran y desafiante tarea de hacerlo.

  "body": " Instructores! Lean esto!  Este libro es diferente. Antes de seguir leyendo, primero lee ¡Estudiantes! ¡Lean esto! así como Nuestros Objetivos .  Entre los tres formatos (HTML, PDF, impreso), el HTML es el óptimo para mostrar en clase si tienes un proyector adecuado. El HTML también es el mejor para la navegación, ya que los enlaces a referencias internas y externas son mucho más evidentes. Recomendamos guardar una versión descargada del formato PDF como respaldo en caso de que no tengas acceso a Internet. Es una buena idea que cada estudiante tenga una versión impresa del Libro de Actividades, que puedes adquirir como un documento PDF solicitándolo directamente al autor (boelkinm en gvsu punto edu); muchos instructores usan el PDF para hacer paquetes de curso que los estudiantes pueden comprar en su librería local.  El texto está escrito de manera que, en promedio, una sección corresponde a dos horas de tiempo de clase. Una secuencia de instrucción típica al comenzar una nueva sección podría verse de la siguiente manera:   Los estudiantes completan una Actividad de Preparación antes de la clase. La clase comienza con un breve análisis entre compañeros seguido de una discusión con toda la clase. (5-10 minutos)    Breve explicación y discusión para desarrollar la actividad de preparación y preparar el escenario para la siguiente actividad. (5-10 minutos)    Los estudiantes se involucran con sus compañeros para trabajar y discutir la primera actividad de la sección. (15-20 minutos)    Breve discusión y posiblemente una explicación para concluir la actividad anterior, seguida de una transición a nuevas ideas. (Varía, pero de 5 a 15 minutos)    Posiblemente comenzar la siguiente actividad.   La siguiente hora de clase sería similar, pero sin la Actividad de Preparación para completar antes de la clase: el enfoque principal de la clase será completar 2 actividades. Luego, enjuaga y repite.  Recomendamos que los instructores utilicen incentivos apropiados para animar a los estudiantes a completar las Actividades de Preparación antes de la clase. Hacer que estas sean parte de tareas basadas en la finalización que cuentan un 5% de la calificación del semestre generalmente resulta en que la gran mayoría de los estudiantes completen la gran mayoría de las actividades de preparación. Si deseas ver un ejemplo de plan de estudios sobre cómo organizar un curso y ponderar varias tareas, puedes solicitar uno por correo electrónico al autor.  Ten en cuenta que los ejercicios de WeBWorK en la versión HTML son anónimos y no hay forma de rastrear el compromiso de los estudiantes con ellos. Estos están destinados a ser formativos para los estudiantes y proporcionarles retroalimentación inmediata sin penalización. Si tu institución es usuaria de WeBWorK , en un futuro próximo tendremos conjuntos de archivos .def que corresponden a las secciones del texto; estos estarán disponibles previa solicitud al autor.    El código fuente de PreTeXt para el texto se puede encontrar en GitHub . Si encuentras errores en el texto o tienes otras sugerencias, puedes presentar un problema en GitHub o enviar un correo electrónico directamente al autor. Para interactuar con instructores que usan el texto, mantenemos tanto una lista de correo electrónico como el blog Open Calculus ; puedes solicitar que tu dirección sea añadida a la lista de correo contactando al autor. Finalmente, si estás interesado en una presentación en video sobre el uso del texto similar Active Calculus , puedes ver esta presentación en video en línea en el Seminario Electrónico de Educación Matemática del MIT ; aproximadamente en el minuto 17 comienza la parte donde demostramos las características y cómo usar el texto.  Gracias por considerar Preludio Activo al Cálculo como un recurso para ayudar a tus estudiantes a desarrollar una comprensión profunda del tema. Te deseo lo mejor en tu trabajo y espero tener noticias tuyas.  "

  "title": "Cambiando en Simultáneo",
  "body": " Cambiando en Simultáneo     Si tenemos dos cantidades que están cambiando juntas, ¿cómo podemos conectar las cantidades y entender cómo el cambio en una afecta a la otra?    Cuando la cantidad de agua en un tanque está cambiando, ¿qué comportamientos podemos observar?      La matemática es el arte de dar sentido a los patrones. Una forma en que surgen los patrones es cuando dos cantidades cambian simultáneamente. En este contexto, podemos entender la situación expresando la relación entre las cantidades cambiantes a través de palabras, imágenes, datos o a través de una fórmula.    Supongamos que un acuario rectangular se está llenando con agua. El tanque mide metros de largo por metros de ancho por metros de alto, y la manguera que está llenando el tanque está entregando agua a una velocidad de metros cúbicos por minuto.    El acuario vacío     El acuario, parcialmente lleno.        ¿Qué cantidades diferentes están cambiando en este escenario?    Después de minuto, ¿cuánta agua hay en el tanque? En este momento, ¿qué profundidad tiene el agua?    ¿Cuánta agua hay en el tanque y qué profundidad tiene el agua después de minutos? ¿Después de minutos?    ¿Cuánto tiempo tomará para que el tanque esté completamente lleno? ¿Por qué?         Usando Gráficos para Representar Relaciones  En Preview Activity , vimos cómo varias cantidades cambiantes estaban relacionadas en el contexto de un acuario llenándose con agua: el tiempo, la profundidad del agua y la cantidad total de agua en el tanque están cambiando, y cualquier par de estas cantidades cambia de manera relacionada. Una forma de entender la situación es registrar algunos datos en una tabla. Por ejemplo, observando que el tanque se llena a un ritmo de metros cúbicos por minuto, esto nos dice que después de minuto habrá metros cúbicos de agua en el tanque, y después de minutos habrá metro cúbico de agua en el tanque, y así sucesivamente. Si dejamos que denote el tiempo en minutos y la cantidad de agua en el tanque en el tiempo , podemos representar la relación entre estas cantidades a través de la Tabla .    Datos sobre cómo cambia el volumen de agua en el tanque con el tiempo.                                  Una representación visual de los datos en la Tabla .     También podemos representar estos datos en un gráfico trazando pares ordenados en un sistema de ejes de coordenadas, donde representa la distancia horizontal del punto desde el origen, , y representa la distancia vertical desde . La representación visual de la tabla de valores de Tabla se muestra en el gráfico en Figura .  A veces es posible usar variables y una o más ecuaciones para conectar cantidades que están cambiando conjuntamente. En el ejemplo del acuario de la actividad previa, podemos observar que el volumen, , de una caja rectangular que tiene una longitud , un ancho y una altura se da por , y así, dado que el agua en el tanque siempre tendrá una longitud pies y un ancho pies, el volumen de agua en el tanque está directamente relacionado con la profundidad del agua en el tanque por la ecuación . Dependiendo de qué variable resolvamos, podemos ver cómo depende de a través de la ecuación , o cómo depende de mediante la ecuación . Desde cualquiera de las dos perspectivas, observamos que a medida que la profundidad o el volumen aumentan, el volumen o la profundidad deben aumentar correspondientemente.    Considera un tanque en forma de cono circular invertido (con la punta hacia abajo) donde el radio del tanque es de pies y su profundidad es de pies. Supón que el tanque se está llenando con agua que entra a una tasa constante de pies cúbicos por minuto.     Dibuja un esquema etiquetado del tanque, incluyendo una imagen del tanque con agua antes de que esté completamente lleno.    ¿Cuáles son algunas de las cantidades que están cambiando en este escenario? ¿Cuáles son algunas de las cantidades que no están cambiando?    Llena la siguiente tabla de valores para determinar cuánta agua, , hay en el tanque en un tiempo dado en minutos, , y así generar un gráfico de la relación entre volumen y tiempo trazando los datos en los ejes proporcionados.    Tabla para registrar datos sobre volumen y tiempo en el tanque cónico.                                  Cómo cambian conjuntamente el volumen y el tiempo en el tanque cónico.       Finalmente, piensa en cómo la altura, , del agua cambia conjuntamente con el tiempo. Sin intentar determinar valores específicos de en valores particulares de , ¿cómo esperarías que aparecieran los datos de la relación entre y ? Usa los ejes proporcionados para esbozar al menos dos posibilidades; escribe al menos una oración para explicar cómo crees que debería aparecer el gráfico.                     Usando el Álgebra para Agregar Perspectiva  Una de las formas en que entendemos las ideas matemáticas es viéndolas desde múltiples perspectivas. Podemos usar diferentes medios para establecer diferentes puntos de vista: palabras, datos numéricos, gráficos o símbolos. Además, a veces al cambiar nuestra perspectiva dentro de un enfoque particular, obtenemos una comprensión más profunda.    El tanque cónico vacío.     El tanque cónico, parcialmente lleno.     Si consideramos el tanque cónico discutido en Activity , como se ve en Figure y Figure , podemos usar el álgebra para comprender mejor algunas de las relaciones entre las cantidades que cambian. El volumen de un cono volumen cono con radio y altura se da por la fórmula .  Nota que en cualquier momento mientras se llena el tanque, (el radio de la superficie del agua), (la profundidad del agua) y (el volumen del agua) están cambiando; además, todos están conectados entre sí. Debido a las restricciones del propio tanque (con un radio de pies y una profundidad de pies), se sigue que a medida que el radio y la altura del agua cambian, siempre lo hacen en la proporción . Resolviendo esta última ecuación para , vemos que ; sustituyendo este resultado más reciente en la ecuación del volumen, se sigue que .  Esta ecuación más reciente nos ayuda a entender cómo y cambian conjuntamente. Sabemos por nuestro trabajo anterior que el volumen de agua en el tanque aumenta a una tasa constante de pies cúbicos por minuto. Esto conduce a los datos mostrados en Table .   Cómo cambian conjuntamente el tiempo y el volumen en un tanque cónico.                       Con la ecuación , ahora también podemos ver cómo la altura del agua cambia conjuntamente con el tiempo. Resolviendo la ecuación para , notamos que , y por lo tanto . Así, cuando , se sigue que . Ejecutando cálculos similares con los otros valores de en Table , obtenemos los siguientes datos actualizados que ahora incluyen .   Cómo cambian conjuntamente el tiempo, el volumen y la altura en un tanque cónico.                                Al graficar estos datos en dos conjuntos de ejes diferentes, vemos las distintas formas en que y cambian con . Mientras que el volumen aumenta a una tasa constante, como se puede ver en la apariencia de línea recta de los puntos en Figure , observamos que la altura del agua aumenta de manera que se eleva más lentamente a medida que pasa el tiempo, como se muestra en la forma en que la curva en la que se encuentran los puntos en Figure  se inclina hacia abajo a medida que pasa el tiempo.    Graficando versus .     Graficando versus .     Estos comportamientos diferentes tienen sentido debido a la forma del tanque. Dado que al principio hay menos volumen en relación con la profundidad cerca de la punta del cono, a medida que el agua fluye a una tasa constante, la altura del agua aumentará rápidamente. Pero a medida que pasa el tiempo y se añade más agua a la misma tasa, hay más espacio para que el agua llene para que el nivel del agua suba, y por lo tanto, la altura del agua sube cada vez más lentamente a medida que pasa el tiempo.    Considera un tanque en forma de esfera donde el radio del tanque es de pies. Supón que el tanque está inicialmente completamente lleno y que se está vaciando mediante una bomba a una tasa constante de pies cúbicos por minuto.     Dibuja un esquema etiquetado del tanque, incluyendo una imagen del tanque con algo de agua antes de que esté completamente vacío.    ¿Cuáles son algunas de las cantidades que están cambiando en este escenario? ¿Cuáles son algunas de las cantidades que no están cambiando?    Recuerda que el volumen de una esfera de radio es . Cuando el tanque está completamente lleno en el momento , justo antes de empezar a vaciarse, ¿cuánta agua hay presente?    ¿Cuánto tiempo tomará para que el tanque se vacíe completamente?    Complete la siguiente tabla de valores para determinar cuánta agua, , hay en el tanque en un momento dado en minutos, , y así generar un gráfico de la relación entre el volumen y el tiempo. Escribe una oración para explicar por qué el gráfico de los datos aparece de la manera en que lo hace.    Datos sobre cómo cambian juntos el volumen y el tiempo.                                  Un gráfico de cómo cambian el volumen y el tiempo en conjunto en un tanque esférico que se está drenando.       Finalmente, piensa en cómo cambia la altura del agua junto con el tiempo. ¿Cuál es la altura del agua cuando ? ¿Cuál es la altura cuando el tanque está vacío? ¿Cómo esperarías que aparezcan los datos de la relación entre y ? Utiliza los ejes proporcionados para esbozar al menos dos posibilidades; escribe al menos una oración para explicar cómo crees que debería aparecer el gráfico.                     Resumen     Cuando dos cantidades relacionadas están cambiando conjuntamente, podemos entender mejor cómo el cambio en una afecta a la otra utilizando datos, gráficos, palabras o símbolos algebraicos para expresar la relación entre ellas. Ver, por ejemplo, Tabla , Figura , , y Ecuación que juntas ayudan a explicar cómo la altura y el volumen de agua en un tanque cónico cambian conjuntamente a medida que cambia el tiempo.    Cuando la cantidad de agua en un tanque está cambiando, podemos observar otras cantidades que cambian, dependiendo de la forma del tanque. Por ejemplo, si el tanque es cónico, podemos considerar tanto la altura cambiante del agua como el radio cambiante de la superficie del agua. Además, siempre que pensamos en una cantidad que está cambiando con el paso del tiempo, notamos que el tiempo mismo está cambiando.          The graph below shows the fuel consumption (in miles per gallon, mpg) of a car driving at various speeds (in miles per hour, mph).   (click on image to enlarge)  (a) How much gas is used on a 400 mile trip at 80 mph?  amount of gas = gallons  (b) How much gas is saved by traveling 60 mph instead of 70 mph on a 600 mile trip?  saved gas = gallons  (c) According to this graph, what is the most fuel efficient speed to travel?  most fuel efficient speed = mph                  SOLUTION (a) At 80 mph, fuel consumption is about 24 mpg, so fuel used is . (b) At 60 mph, fuel consumption is about 30 mpg, so fuel used on a 600 mile trip is . At 70 mph, fuel consumption is about 27 mpg, so fuel used on this trip is . Altogether we would then save . (c) The most fuel efficient speed is where mpg is a maximum, which is about 55 mph.        Suppose we have an unusual tank whose base is a perfect sphere with radius feet, and then atop the spherical base is a cylindrical chimney that is a circular cylinder of radius foot and height feet, as shown in Figure . The tank is initially empty, but then a spigot is turned on that pumps water into the tank at a constant rate of cubic feet per minute.   A spherical tank with a cylindrical chimney.    Let denote the total volume of water (in cubic feet) in the tank at any time (in minutes), and the depth of the water (in feet) at time .     It is possible to use calculus to show that the total volume this tank can hold is cubic feet. In addition, the actual height of the tank (from the bottom of the spherical base to the top of the chimney) is feet. How long does it take the tank to fill? Why?    On the blank axes provided below, sketch (by hand) possible graphs of how and change in tandem and how and change in tandem.      For each graph, label any ordered pairs on the graph that you know for certain, and write at least one sentence that explains why your graphs have the shape they do.    How would your graph(s) change (if at all) if the chimney was shaped like an inverted cone instead of a cylinder? Explain and discuss.      Exercise Answer   Exercise Solution    Suppose we have a tank that is a perfect sphere with radius feet. The tank is initially empty, but then a spigot is turned on that is pumping water into the tank in a very special way: the faucet is regulated so that the depth of water in the tank is increasing at a constant rate of feet per minute.  Let denote the total volume of water (in cubic feet) in the tank at any time (in minutes), and the depth of the water (in feet) at given time .     How long does it take the tank to fill? What will the values of and be at the moment the tank is full? Why?    On the blank axes provided below, sketch (by hand) possible graphs of how and change in tandem and how and change in tandem.      For each graph, label any ordered pairs on the graph that you know for certain, and write at least one sentence that explains why your graphs have the shape they do.

  "body": " Funciones: Modelando Relaciones     ¿Cómo podemos usar la idea matemática de una función para representar la relación entre dos cantidades que cambian?    ¿Cuáles son algunas características formales de una función matemática abstracta? ¿Cómo pensamos de manera diferente sobre estas características en el contexto de un modelo físico?      Un modelo matemático es un concepto abstracto a través del cual usamos el lenguaje y la notación matemática para describir un fenómeno en el mundo que nos rodea. Un ejemplo de un modelo matemático se encuentra en La Ley de Dolbear Puedes leer más en la entrada de Wikipedia sobre la Ley de Dolbear, que ha demostrado ser notablemente precisa para el comportamiento de los grillos de árbol nevados. Para conocer más sobre esta historia, incluyendo una referencia a este fenómeno en el popular programa The Big Bang Theory , consulta este artículo. . La Ley de Dolbear En la década de 1800, el físico Amos Dolbear estaba escuchando el canto de los grillos y notó un patrón: la frecuencia de los cantos de los grillos parecía estar relacionada con la temperatura exterior. Si dejamos que represente la temperatura en grados Fahrenheit y el número de chirridos por minuto, podemos resumir las observaciones de Dolbear en la siguiente tabla.   Datos de las observaciones de Dolbear.    (chirridos por minuto)        ( Fahrenheit)         Para un modelo matemático, a menudo buscamos una fórmula algebraica que capture el comportamiento observado con precisión y que pueda usarse para predecir un comportamiento aún no observado. Para los datos en Tabla , observamos que cada uno de los pares ordenados en la tabla hace que la ecuación sea verdadera. Por ejemplo, . De hecho, los científicos que realizaron muchas observaciones adicionales de chirridos de grillos después de los conteos iniciales de Dolbear encontraron que la fórmula en Ecuación se mantiene con una precisión notable para el grillo de árbol nevado en temperaturas que van desde aproximadamente F hasta F.    Usa la Ecuación para responder a las preguntas a continuación.     Si escuchamos grillos de árbol nevados cantando a una tasa de chirridos por minuto, ¿qué sugiere el modelo de Dolbear que debería ser la temperatura exterior?    Si la temperatura exterior es de F, ¿cuántos chirridos por minuto deberíamos esperar escuchar?    ¿Es válido el modelo para determinar el número de chirridos que uno debería escuchar cuando la temperatura exterior es de F? ¿Por qué o por qué no?    Supongamos que por la mañana un observador escucha chirridos por minuto, y varias horas más tarde escucha chirridos por minuto. ¿Cuánto ha subido la temperatura entre las observaciones?    Se sabe que la Ley de Dolbear es precisa para temperaturas de a . ¿Cuál es el menor número de chirridos por minuto que un observador podría esperar escuchar? ¿El mayor número de chirridos por minuto?         Funciones  El concepto matemático de una función  función introducción a es una de las ideas más centrales en toda la matemática, en parte porque las funciones proporcionan una herramienta importante para representar y explicar patrones. En su esencia, una función es un proceso repetible que toma una colección de valores de entrada y genera una colección correspondiente de valores de salida con la propiedad de que si usamos una entrada particular, el proceso siempre produce exactamente la misma salida.  Por ejemplo, la Ley de Dolbear en Ecuación proporciona un proceso que toma un número dado de chirridos entre y por minuto y produce de manera fiable la temperatura correspondiente que se relaciona con el número de chirridos, y así esta ecuación genera una función. A menudo damos nombres abreviados a las funciones; usando para la función Dolbear , podemos representar el proceso de tomar entradas (tasas de chirridos observadas) a salidas (temperaturas correspondientes) usando flechas: Alternativamente, para la relación también podemos usar la notación equivalente para indicar que la Ley de Dolbear toma una entrada de chirridos por minuto y produce una salida correspondiente de grados Fahrenheit. Más generalmente, escribimos para indicar que una cierta temperatura, , está determinada por un número dado de chirridos por minuto, , según el proceso .  Las tablas y los gráficos son formas particularmente valiosas de caracterizar y representar funciones. Para el ejemplo actual, resumimos algunos de los datos que la función de Dolbear genera en Tabla y graficamos esos datos junto con la curva subyacente en Figura .    Datos para la función .                              Gráfico de los datos de la función and the underlying curve.     Cuando un punto como en la Figura se encuentra en el gráfico de una función, esto indica la correspondencia entre entrada y salida: cuando se introduce el valor chirridos por minuto en la función , el resultado es grados Fahrenheit. Más concisamente, . En voz alta, leemos de es .  Para la mayoría de los conceptos importantes en matemáticas, la comunidad matemática decide sobre definiciones formales para asegurar que tengamos un lenguaje compartido de entendimiento. En este texto, utilizaremos la siguiente definición del término función .   function definition   Una función es un proceso que puede aplicarse a una colección de valores de entrada para producir una colección correspondiente de valores de salida de tal manera que el proceso produce un solo valor de salida para cualquier valor de entrada único.    Si nombramos una función dada y llamamos a la colección de posibles entradas a el conjunto y la colección correspondiente de posibles salidas , decimos es una función de a , y a veces escribimos . Cuando un valor de entrada particular para , digamos , produce una salida correspondiente , escribimos y leemos esta notación simbólica como de es .  función notación A menudo llamamos a la variable independiente  función variable independiente y a la variable dependiente  función variable dependiente , ya que es una función de .   function domain  function codomain   Sea una función de a . El conjunto de posibles entradas a se llama el dominio de ; el conjunto de posibles salidas de se llama el codominio de .    Para la función de Dolbear en el contexto de modelar la temperatura como una función del número de chirridos de grillos por minuto, el dominio de la función es La notación significa la colección de todos los números reales que satisfacen y a veces se llama notación de intervalo . y el codominio es todas las temperaturas en Fahrenheit . El codominio de una función es la colección de salidas posibles , que distinguimos de la colección de salidas reales .   function range   Sea una función de a . El rango de es la colección de todas las salidas reales de la función. Es decir, el rango es la colección de todos los elementos en para los cuales es posible encontrar un elemento en tal que .    En muchas situaciones, el rango de una función es mucho más difícil de determinar que su codominio. Para la función de Dolbear, el rango es fácil de encontrar usando el gráfico mostrado en la Figura : dado que las salidas reales de están entre y e incluyen todos los valores en ese intervalo, el rango de es .  El rango de cualquier función es siempre un subconjunto del codominio. Es posible que el rango sea igual al codominio.    Considera un tanque esférico de radio m que se está llenando de agua. Sea el volumen de agua en el tanque (en metros cúbicos) en un momento dado, y la profundidad del agua (en metros) al mismo tiempo. Se puede demostrar usando cálculo que es una función de según la regla .     ¿Qué valores de tienen sentido considerar en el contexto de esta función? ¿Qué valores de tienen sentido en el mismo contexto?    ¿Cuál es el dominio de la función en el contexto del tanque esférico? ¿Por qué? ¿Cuál es el codominio correspondiente? ¿Por qué?    Determine e interprete (con las unidades apropiadas) los valores , , y . ¿Qué es importante sobre el valor de ?    Considera la afirmación: dado que , cuando el agua tiene metros de profundidad, hay aproximadamente metros cúbicos de agua en el tanque . ¿Es válida esta afirmación? ¿Por qué o por qué no? Además, ¿tiene sentido observar que ? ¿Por qué o por qué no?    ¿Puedes determinar un valor de para el cual metros cúbicos?                 Comparando modelos y funciones abstractas  Nuevamente, un modelo matemático es un concepto abstracto mediante el cual utilizamos lenguaje y notación matemática para describir un fenómeno en el mundo que nos rodea. Hasta ahora, hemos considerado dos ejemplos diferentes: la función de Dolbear, , que modela cómo la temperatura en grados Fahrenheit es una función del número de chirridos de grillos por minuto, y la función que modela cómo el volumen de agua en un tanque esférico de radio m es una función de la profundidad del agua en el tanque. Aunque a menudo consideramos una función en el contexto físico de algún modelo, también hay muchas ocasiones en las que consideramos una función abstracta por sí misma para estudiarla y comprenderla.   Una parábola y una bola en caída   El cálculo muestra que para una pelota de tenis lanzada verticalmente desde una ventana a pies sobre el suelo con una velocidad vertical inicial de pies por segundo, la altura de la pelota sobre el suelo en el tiempo (donde es el instante en que se lanza la pelota) puede ser modelada por la función . Discuta las diferencias entre el modelo y la función abstracta determinada por .    Comenzamos con la función abstracta . En ausencia de un contexto físico, podemos investigar el comportamiento de esta función calculando valores de la función, trazando puntos y pensando en su comportamiento general. Reconocemos que la función es cuadrática Realizaremos una breve revisión de las funciones cuadráticas en la Sección , notando que se abre hacia abajo debido al coeficiente principal de , con el vértice ubicado en , la intersección con el eje en y las intersecciones con el eje en y porque . Calculando algunos puntos adicionales para obtener más información, vemos tanto los datos en la Tabla como el gráfico correspondiente en la Figura .    Datos para la función .                                      Gráfico de la función y algunos datos de la tabla     Para esta función abstracta, su dominio es todos los números reales ya que podemos ingresar cualquier número real que deseemos en la fórmula y obtener un resultado definido. Además, tomar un número real y procesarlo en la fórmula producirá otro número real. Esto nos dice que el codominio de la función abstracta es también todos los números reales. Finalmente, a partir del gráfico y los datos, observamos que el mayor valor posible de la función es . Es evidente que podemos generar cualquier valor de menor o igual a , y así el rango de la función abstracta es todos los números reales menores o iguales a . Denotamos esta colección de números reales utilizando la notación de intervalo . La notación representa todos los números reales que se encuentran a la izquierda de e incluyendo . El indica que no hay un límite a la izquierda en el intervalo.   A continuación, dirigimos nuestra atención al modelo que representa la altura de la pelota, , en pies, segundos después de que la pelota es lanzada inicialmente. Aquí, la gran diferencia es el dominio, el codominio y el rango asociados con el modelo. Dado que el modelo entra en efecto una vez que la pelota es lanzada, solo tiene sentido considerar el modelo para valores de entrada . Además, debido a que el modelo deja de aplicarse una vez que la pelota aterriza, solo es válido para . Así, el dominio de es . Para el codominio, solo tiene sentido considerar valores de que sean no negativos. Es decir, al pensar en las salidas potenciales para el modelo, solo pueden estar en el intervalo . Finalmente, podemos considerar el gráfico del modelo en el dominio dado en la Figura y ver que el rango del modelo es , la colección de todas las alturas entre su punto más bajo (nivel del suelo) y su punto más alto (en el vértice).    Datos para el modelo .                          Gráfico del modelo y algunos datos de la tabla.         Considera un tanque esférico de radio m que está completamente lleno de agua. Supongamos que el tanque se está vaciando regulando una válvula de salida de tal manera que la altura del agua en el tanque siempre disminuye a una tasa de metros por minuto. Sea el volumen de agua en el tanque (en metros cúbicos) en un tiempo dado (en minutos), y la profundidad del agua (en metros) al mismo tiempo. Se puede demostrar usando cálculo que es una función de de acuerdo con el modelo . Además, sea la función cuyo resultado es la profundidad del agua en el tanque en el tiempo .     ¿Cuál es la altura del agua cuando ? ¿Cuando ? ¿Cuando ? ¿Cuánto tiempo tomará vaciar completamente el tanque? ¿Por qué?    ¿Cuál es el dominio del modelo ? ¿Cuál es el dominio del modelo ?    ¿Cuánta agua hay en el tanque cuando el tanque está lleno? ¿Cuál es el rango del modelo ? ¿Cuál es el rango del modelo ?    Usaremos con frecuencia una utilidad de gráficos para ayudarnos a entender el comportamiento de las funciones, y recomendamos encarecidamente Desmos porque es intuitiva, en línea y gratuita. Para aprender más sobre Desmos , consulte sus excelentes tutoriales en línea .   En esta hoja de trabajo preparada en Desmos , puedes ver cómo ingresamos la función (abstracta) , así como el gráfico correspondiente que genera el programa. Haz tantas observaciones como puedas sobre el modelo . Debes discutir su forma y comportamiento general, su dominio, su rango y más.    ¿En qué se diferencia el modelo de la función abstracta ? En particular, ¿en qué se diferencian el dominio y el rango del modelo de los de la función abstracta, si es que se diferencian?    ¿Cómo debería aparecer el gráfico de la función de altura ? ¿Puedes determinar una fórmula para ? Explica tu razonamiento.                 Determinando si una relación es una función o no  Hasta este punto en nuestra discusión sobre funciones, nos hemos centrado principalmente en qué puede modelar el proceso de una función y en cuál es el dominio, codominio y rango de un modelo o una función abstracta. También es importante tomar nota de otra parte de la Definición : el proceso produce un solo valor de salida para cualquier valor de entrada . Dicho de otra manera, si una relación o proceso alguna vez asocia una sola entrada con dos o más salidas diferentes, el proceso no puede ser una función.    ¿Es la relación entre personas y números de teléfono una función?   Solución . No, esta relación no es una función. Una persona individual puede estar asociada con más de un número de teléfono, como su celular y su teléfono de trabajo. Esto significa que no podemos ver los números de teléfono como una función de personas: una entrada (una persona) puede llevar a dos salidas diferentes (números de teléfono). Tampoco podemos ver a las personas como una función de números de teléfono, ya que más de una persona puede estar asociada con un número de teléfono, como cuando una familia comparte un solo teléfono en casa.      La relación entre e que se da en la siguiente tabla donde intentamos ver como dependiente de .   Una tabla que relaciona los valores de e .                      Solución. La relación entre y en la Tabla nos permite pensar en como una función de ya que cada entrada particular está asociada con una y solo una salida. Si nombramos la función , podemos decir, por ejemplo, que . Además, el dominio de es el conjunto de entradas , y el codominio (que también es el rango) es el conjunto de salidas .      Cada uno de los siguientes enunciados describe una relación entre dos cantidades. Para cada uno, tu tarea es decidir si la relación puede considerarse como una función o no.

Para que una relación o proceso sea una función, cada entrada individual debe estar asociada con una y solo una salida. Por lo tanto, la forma habitual de demostrar que una relación o proceso no es una función es encontrar una entrada particular que esté asociada con dos o más salidas. Cuando la relación se da gráficamente, como en la Figura , podemos usar la prueba de la línea vertical para determinar si el gráfico representa una función o no.   Prueba de la Línea Vertical  prueba de la línea vertical  Un gráfico en el plano representa una función si y solo si cada línea vertical intersecta el gráfico a lo sumo una vez. Cuando el gráfico pasa esta prueba, la coordenada vertical de cada punto en el gráfico puede ser vista como una función de la coordenada horizontal del punto.   Dado que la línea vertical pasa a través del círculo en la Figura en ambos y , el círculo no representa una relación donde es una función de . Sin embargo, dado que cualquier línea vertical que dibujemos en la Figura intersecta la curva azul a lo sumo una vez, el gráfico realmente representa una función.  Concluimos con una definición formal del gráfico de una función.   function graph   Sea , donde y son cada uno colecciones de números reales. El gráfico de es la colección de todos los pares ordenados que satisfacen .    Cuando usamos un dispositivo de computación como Desmos para graficar una función , el programa está generando una gran colección de pares ordenados , trazándolos en el plano - y conectando los puntos con segmentos de línea cortos.    Resumen     Una función es un proceso que genera una relación entre dos colecciones de cantidades. La función asocia cada miembro de una colección de valores de entrada con uno y solo un miembro de la colección de valores de salida. Una función puede ser descrita o definida mediante palabras, una tabla de valores, un gráfico o una fórmula.    Las funciones pueden ser vistas como objetos matemáticos dignos de estudio por sí mismos y también como modelos que representan fenómenos físicos en el mundo que nos rodea. Cada función o modelo tiene un dominio (el conjunto de valores de entrada posibles o permitidos), un codominio (el conjunto de valores de salida posibles) y un rango (el conjunto de todos los valores de salida reales). Tanto el codominio como el rango dependen del dominio. Para una función abstracta, el dominio generalmente se considera como la colección más amplia posible de valores de entrada; para una función que modela un fenómeno físico, el dominio generalmente está determinado por el contexto de posibilidades para la entrada en el fenómeno considerado.          Based on the graphs of and below, answer the following questions. If a question has more than one answer, fill in your answer as a list of values separated by commas. Thus for example if you think when , when , and when , you would enter 20, 25, 29 (or any other order of these three numbers separated by commas).

(d) For what value(s) of is\/are ?                              SOLUTION  (a)  . The -coordinate of the point on the graph of when is . (b) ( 6.1 , 4.9 ) and ( 2.2 , 2.9 ). The -coordinate of the point on the graph of (the dashed line) when is . Similarly, the -coordinate of the point on the graph of (the dashed line) when is . (c) There are three points on the graph of which have a -coordinate of 2.9: , and . (d) Two functions are equal when their graphs intersect. The graphs of and intersect at two points, when and .        The table below , the amount of money (in billions of dollars) in bills of denomination circulating in US currency in 2005. For example according to the table values below there were $60.2 billion worth of $50 bills in circulation.    Denomination (value of bill)  1  5  10  20  50  100    Dollar Value in Circulation  8.4  9.7  14.8  110.1  60.2  524.5    a) Find   b) Using your answer in (a), what was the total number of $20 bills (not amount of money) in circulation in 2005?  There was a total number of billion $20 bills in circulation.  c) Are the following statements True or False?   There were more 20 dollar bills than 100 dollar bills    There were more 5 dollar bills than 20 dollar bills               SOLUTION a) because when the entry in the top row is 20 , the corresponding entry below it is 110.1. b) The value 110.1 from part (a) indicates the total value (in billions of dollars) of $20 bills in circulation, not the number of $20 bills. The total number (in billions) of $20 bills in circulation equals the total value in circulation, f(20) = 110.1, divided by 20 (the value of each $20 bill): c) Using the same logic as in (b) calculate the number of each bill in circulation by finding the total value in circulation, , and dividing by the value of the bill, . Then compare the number of each bill in circulation, , for the given values of in order to determine whether the statements are true or false.        Let denote the number of people eating in a restaurant minutes after 5 PM. Answer the following questions:  a) Which of the following statements best describes the significance of the expression ?

Every minutes, more people have begun eating    hours after 5 PM there are people eating    minutes after 5 PM there are people eating    hours after 5 PM there are people eating    None of the above     SOLUTION a) The input 4 corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM, and the output 21 indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time. Thus the mathematical expression means there are 21 people eating at 5:04 PM. b) The output 20 indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at a particular time (in minutes after 5 PM). Thus the mathematical expression means minutes after 5 PM there are 20 people eating. c) The input 20 corresponds to the number of minutes past 5 PM. Thus the mathematical expression means there are people eating at 5:20 PM. d) The corresponds to the time (in number of minutes past 5 PM), and the output indicates the number of people who are eating in the restaurant at this time. Thus the mathematical expression indicates there are people eating in the restaurant minutes past 5 PM. None of these statements explain this correctly, so the answer is None of the above.

Discuta las diferencias entre el modelo y la función abstracta determinada por .    Comenzamos con la función abstracta . En ausencia de un contexto físico, podemos investigar el comportamiento de esta función calculando valores de la función, trazando puntos y pensando en su comportamiento general. Reconocemos que la función es cuadrática Realizaremos una breve revisión de las funciones cuadráticas en la Sección , notando que se abre hacia abajo debido al coeficiente principal de , con el vértice ubicado en , la intersección con el eje en y las intersecciones con el eje en y porque .

Además, tomar un número real y procesarlo en la fórmula producirá otro número real. Esto nos dice que el codominio de la función abstracta es también todos los números reales. Finalmente, a partir del gráfico y los datos, observamos que el mayor valor posible de la función es . Es evidente que podemos generar cualquier valor de menor o igual a , y así el rango de la función abstracta es todos los números reales menores o iguales a . Denotamos esta colección de números reales utilizando la notación de intervalo . La notación representa todos los números reales que se encuentran a la izquierda de e incluyendo . El indica que no hay un límite a la izquierda en el intervalo.   A continuación, dirigimos nuestra atención al modelo que representa la altura de la pelota, , en pies, segundos después de que la pelota es lanzada inicialmente. Aquí, la gran diferencia es el dominio, el codominio y el rango asociados con el modelo. Dado que el modelo entra en efecto una vez que la pelota es lanzada, solo tiene sentido considerar el modelo para valores de entrada . Además, debido a que el modelo deja de aplicarse una vez que la pelota aterriza, solo es válido para . Así, el dominio de es . Para el codominio, solo tiene sentido considerar valores de que sean no negativos. Es decir, al pensar en las salidas potenciales para el modelo, solo pueden estar en el intervalo .

  "body": " La Tasa de Cambio Promedio de una Función     ¿Qué queremos decir con la tasa de cambio promedio de una función en un intervalo?    ¿Qué mide la tasa de cambio promedio de una función? ¿Cómo interpretamos su significado en contexto?    ¿Cómo está conectada la tasa de cambio promedio de una función con una línea que pasa por dos puntos en la curva?      Dada una función que modela un cierto fenómeno, es natural hacer preguntas como ¿cómo está cambiando la función en un intervalo dado? o ¿en qué intervalo está cambiando la función más rápidamente? El concepto de tasa de cambio promedio nos permite hacer estas preguntas más precisas matemáticamente. Inicialmente, nos enfocaremos en la tasa de cambio promedio de un objeto que se mueve a lo largo de un camino en línea recta.  Para una función que indica la ubicación de un objeto en movimiento a lo largo de un camino recto en el tiempo , definimos la tasa de cambio promedio de en el intervalo como la cantidad . tasa de cambio promedio de la posición Nota especialmente que la tasa de cambio promedio de en mide el cambio en la posición dividido por el cambio en el tiempo .   Sea la función de altura para una pelota lanzada verticalmente dada por , donde se mide en segundos y se mide en pies sobre el suelo.     Calcula el valor de .    ¿Cuáles son las unidades de la cantidad ? ¿Cuál es el significado de este número en el contexto de la pelota que sube y baja?    En Desmos , grafica la función junto con los puntos y . Haz una copia de tu gráfico en los ejes en Figura , etiquetando puntos clave así como la escala en tus ejes. ¿Cuál es el dominio del modelo? ¿El rango? ¿Por qué?   Ejes para graficar la función de posición.      Trabaja a mano para encontrar la ecuación de la línea que pasa por los puntos y . Escribe la línea en la forma y grafica la línea en Desmos , así como en los ejes anteriores.    ¿Cuál es una interpretación geométrica del valor a la luz de tu trabajo en las preguntas anteriores?    ¿Cómo cambian tus respuestas en las preguntas anteriores si en lugar de eso consideramos el intervalo ? ? ?        Definiendo e interpretando la tasa de cambio promedio de una función  En el contexto de una función que mide la altura o posición de un objeto en movimiento en un momento dado, el significado de la tasa de cambio promedio de la función en un intervalo dado es la velocidad promedio  velocidad promedio del objeto en movimiento porque es la razón entre el cambio en la posición y el cambio en el tiempo . Por ejemplo, en Actividad de Vista Previa , las unidades de son pies por segundo ya que las unidades en el numerador son pies y en el denominador segundos . Además, es numéricamente el mismo valor que la pendiente de la línea que conecta los dos puntos correspondientes en el gráfico de la función de posición, como se ve en Figura . El hecho de que la tasa de cambio promedio sea negativa en este ejemplo indica que la pelota está cayendo.    La tasa de cambio promedio de en para la función en Actividad de Vista Previa .     La tasa de cambio promedio de una función abstracta en el intervalo .     Mientras que la tasa de cambio promedio de una función de posición nos dice la velocidad promedio del objeto en movimiento, en otros contextos, la tasa de cambio promedio de una función puede definirse de manera similar y tiene una interpretación relacionada. Hacemos la siguiente definición formal.   tasa promedio de cambio   Para una función definida en un intervalo , la tasa de cambio promedio de en es la cantidad .    En cada situación, las unidades de la tasa de cambio promedio nos ayudan a interpretar su significado, y esas unidades son siempre unidades de salida por unidad de entrada.  tasa de cambio promedio unidades Además, la tasa de cambio promedio de en siempre corresponde a la pendiente de la línea entre los puntos y , como se ve en Figura .    Según el censo de EE. UU., las poblaciones de los condados de Kent y Ottawa en Michigan, donde se encuentra GVSU Grand Rapids está en Kent, Allendale en Ottawa. desde 1960 hasta 2010, medidas en intervalos de años, se presentan en las siguientes tablas.   Datos de población del condado de Kent.    1960  1970  1980  1990  2000  2010    363,187  411,044  444,506  500,631  574,336  602,622      Datos de población del condado de Ottawa.    1960  1970  1980  1990  2000  2010    98,719  128,181  157,174  187,768  238,313  263,801     Sea la población del condado de Kent en el año y la población del condado de Ottawa en el año .     Calcula para ambos y .    ¿Cuáles son las unidades de cada una de las cantidades que calculaste en (a.)?    Escribe una frase cuidadosa que explique el significado de la tasa de cambio promedio de la población del condado de Ottawa en el intervalo de tiempo . Tu frase debería comenzar algo así: En un año promedio entre 1990 y 2010, la población del condado de Ottawa fue     ¿Qué condado tuvo una mayor tasa de cambio promedio durante el intervalo de tiempo ? ¿Hubo algún intervalo en el que uno de los condados tuviera una tasa de cambio promedio negativa?    Usando los datos proporcionados, ¿qué predices que será la población del condado de Ottawa en 2018? ¿Por qué?               La tasa de cambio promedio de una función en un intervalo nos proporciona una excelente manera de describir cómo se comporta la función, en promedio. Por ejemplo, si calculamos para el condado de Kent, encontramos que , lo que nos dice que en un año promedio desde 1970 hasta 2000, la población del condado de Kent aumentó en aproximadamente personas. Dicho de otra manera, también podríamos decir que de 1970 a 2000, el condado de Kent estaba creciendo a una tasa promedio de personas por año. Estas ideas también permiten la oportunidad de hacer comparaciones a lo largo del tiempo. Dado que , no solo podemos decir que la población del condado de Kent aumentó en aproximadamente en un año promedio entre 1990 y 2000, sino también que la población estaba creciendo más rápido de 1990 a 2000 que de 1970 a 2000.  Finalmente, podemos incluso usar la tasa de cambio promedio de una función para predecir el comportamiento futuro. Dado que la población estaba cambiando en promedio en personas por año desde 1990 hasta 2000, podemos estimar que la población en 2002 es .    Cómo la tasa de cambio promedio indica tendencias en la función  Ya hemos visto que es natural usar palabras como creciendo y disminuyendo para describir el comportamiento de una función. Por ejemplo, para la pelota de tenis cuya altura está modelada por , calculamos que , lo que indica que en el intervalo , la altura de la pelota de tenis está disminuyendo a una tasa promedio de pies por segundo. De manera similar, para la población del condado de Kent, dado que , sabemos que en el intervalo la población está aumentando a una tasa promedio de personas por año.  Hacemos las siguientes definiciones formales para aclarar qué significa decir que una función está creciendo o disminuyendo.   tendencias de la función creciendo  tendencias de la función disminuyendo   Sea una función definida en un intervalo (es decir, en el conjunto de todos los para los cuales ). Decimos que está creciendo en siempre que la función esté siempre en aumento al movernos de izquierda a derecha. Es decir, para cualquier y en , si , entonces .  De manera similar, decimos que está disminuyendo en siempre que la función esté siempre en descenso al movernos de izquierda a derecha. Es decir, para cualquier y en , si , entonces .    Si calculamos la tasa de cambio promedio de una función en un intervalo, podemos decidir si la función está creciendo o disminuyendo en promedio en el intervalo, pero se necesita más trabajo El cálculo ofrece una forma de justificar que una función siempre está creciendo o siempre está disminuyendo en un intervalo. para decidir si la función está creciendo o disminuyendo siempre en el intervalo.    Consideremos dos funciones diferentes y veamos cómo los distintos cálculos de su tasa de cambio promedio nos informan sobre su comportamiento respectivo. Los gráficos de y se muestran en Figures y .     Considera la función . Calcula , , , y . ¿Qué te dicen tus dos últimos cálculos sobre el comportamiento de la función en ?    Considera la función . Calcula , , y . ¿Qué te dicen tus cálculos sobre el comportamiento de la función en ?    En los gráficos de Figures y , traza los segmentos de línea cuyas pendientes respectivas son las tasas de cambio promedio que calculaste en (a) y (b).    Plot of from part (a).     Plot of from part (b).       Verdadero o falso: Dado que , la función está aumentando en el intervalo . Justifica tu decisión.    Da un ejemplo de una función que tenga la misma tasa de cambio promedio sin importar el intervalo que elijas. Puedes proporcionar tu ejemplo a través de una tabla, un gráfico, o una fórmula; independientemente de tu elección, escribe una frase para explicar.               Es útil poder conectar información sobre la tasa de cambio promedio de una función y su gráfico. Por ejemplo, si hemos determinado que para alguna función , esto nos dice que, en promedio, la función sube entre los puntos y y lo hace a una tasa promedio de unidades verticales por cada unidad horizontal. Además, podemos incluso determinar que la diferencia entre y es ya que .    Dibuja al menos dos gráficos diferentes que satisfagan los criterios para la función en cada parte. Haz tus gráficos lo más significativamente diferentes posible. Si es imposible que un gráfico satisfaga los criterios, explica por qué.      es una función definida en tal que y .         es una función definida en tal que , y no siempre está creciendo en .         es una función definida en tal que , y .                     Resumen     Para una función definida en un intervalo , la tasa de cambio promedio de en es la cantidad .    El valor de nos dice cuánto sube o baja la función, en promedio, por cada unidad adicional que nos movemos a la derecha en el gráfico. Por ejemplo, si , esto significa que por cada aumento adicional de unidad en el valor de en el intervalo , la función aumenta, en promedio, en unidades. En contextos aplicados, las unidades de son unidades de salida por unidad de entrada .    El valor de es también la pendiente de la línea que pasa por los puntos y en el gráfico de , como se muestra en la Figura .

All others are incorrect: The statement, 0.0072 is the slope of the graph of at d = 75, is incorrect since the average rate of change is the slope of the line segment connect the endpoints of the interval. The statement, The temperature changes by a total of 0.0072 degrees Celsius when moving from a depth 75 meters to 200 meters, is incorrect since the average rate of change is a ratio of the change in temperature divided by the change in depth (not just the total change in temperature. The statement, On average the temperature is changing at a rate of 0.0072 degrees Celsius per minute over the interval , is incorrect since the units must be degrees Celsius per meter (not minute). The statement, The temperature is changing at a rate of 0.0072 degrees Celsius per minute when the depth is 75 meters, is incorrect since the average rate of change averages the rates of change at every point in the interval.

The graph of , the position of the car (measured in thousands of feet from its starting location) at time in minutes.       In everyday language, describe the behavior of the car over the provided time interval. In particular, carefully discuss what is happening on each of the time intervals , , , , and , plus provide commentary overall on what the car is doing on the interval .    Compute the average rate of change of on the intervals , , and . Label your results using the notation appropriately, and include units on each quantity.    On the graph of , sketch the three lines whose slope corresponds to the values of , , and that you computed in (b).    Is there a time interval on which the car's average velocity is feet per minute? Why or why not?    Is there ever a time interval when the car is going in reverse? Why or why not?      Exercise Answer   Exercise Solution    Consider an inverted conical tank (point down) whose top has a radius of feet and that is feet deep. The tank is initially empty and then is filled at a constant rate of cubic feet per minute. Let denote the volume of water (in cubic feet) at time in minutes, and let denote the depth of the water (in feet) at time . It turns out that the formula for the function is .     In everyday language, describe how you expect the height function to behave as time increases.    For the height function , compute , , and . Include units on your results.    Again working with the height function, can you determine an interval on which feet per minute? If yes, state the interval; if not, explain why there is no such interval.

Para una función cuya gráfica es una línea recta, ¿qué estructura tiene su fórmula?    ¿Cómo podemos interpretar la pendiente de una función lineal en contextos aplicados?      Las funciones cuyas gráficas son líneas rectas son tanto las más simples como las más importantes en matemáticas. Las líneas a menudo modelan fenómenos importantes, y aun cuando no modelen directamente fenómenos, las líneas a menudo pueden aproximar otras funciones que sí lo hacen. Si la gráfica de una función es una línea recta o no, está directamente relacionado con su tasa de cambio promedio.       Sea . Determina , , y para la función .    Sea dado por los datos en Table .   Una tabla que define la función .                                 Determina , , y para la función .    Considera la función definida por la gráfica en Figure .   La gráfica de .    Determina , , y para la función .    ¿Qué tienen en común los tres ejemplos anteriores? ¿En qué se diferencian?    Para la función de (a), encuentra la expresión más simple que puedas para donde .         Propiedades de las funciones lineales  En Preview Activity , consideramos tres funciones diferentes para las cuales la tasa de cambio promedio parecía ser siempre constante. Para la primera función en la actividad preliminar, , podemos calcular su tasa de cambio promedio en un intervalo arbitrario . Haciendo esto, notamos que . Este resultado nos muestra que para la función , su tasa de cambio promedio es siempre , sin importar el intervalo que elijamos. Usaremos la propiedad de tener una tasa de cambio constante como la propiedad definitoria de una función lineal.   linear function  linear function slope   Una función es lineal siempre que su tasa de cambio promedio sea constante en cualquier elección de intervalo en su dominio Aquí estamos considerando funciones cuyo dominio es el conjunto de todos los números reales. . Es decir, para cualquier entrada y para las cuales , se sigue que para alguna constante fija . Llamamos a la pendiente de la función lineal .    Por estudios previos, ya sabemos mucho sobre las funciones lineales. En esta sección, trabajamos para entender algunas propiedades familiares a la luz de la nueva perspectiva de la Definición .  Supongamos que sabemos que una función es lineal con una tasa de cambio promedio y que también sabemos que el valor de la función es en alguna entrada fija . Es decir, sabemos que . A partir de esta información, podemos encontrar la fórmula para para cualquier entrada . Trabajando con el punto conocido y cualquier otro punto en la gráfica de la función, sabemos que la tasa de cambio promedio entre estos dos puntos debe ser la constante . Esto nos dice que . Como estamos interesados en encontrar una fórmula para , resolvemos esta ecuación más reciente para . Multiplicando ambos lados por , vemos que . Sumando a cada lado, se sigue que . Esto muestra que para determinar la fórmula de una función lineal, todo lo que necesitamos saber es su tasa de cambio promedio (o pendiente) y un solo punto por el cual pasa la función.    Encuentra una fórmula para una función lineal cuya tasa de cambio promedio es y pasa por el punto .   Solución . Usando la Ecuación y los hechos de que y (es decir, y ), tenemos .    Reemplazando con y con , llamamos a la Ecuación la forma punto-pendiente  forma punto-pendiente de una línea.   Forma punto-pendiente de una línea  line point-slope form  Una línea con pendiente (equivalente a una tasa de cambio promedio ) que pasa por el punto tiene la ecuación .     Encuentra una ecuación para la línea que está determinada por las siguientes condiciones; escribe tu respuesta en la forma punto-pendiente siempre que sea posible.     La línea con pendiente que pasa por .    La línea que pasa por los puntos y .    La línea que pasa por y es paralela a la línea .    Explica por qué la función dada por la Tabla parece ser lineal y encuentra una fórmula para .    Datos para una función lineal .                          Gráfica de una función lineal .       Encuentra una fórmula para la función lineal mostrada en la Figura .               Visualizar los diversos componentes de la forma punto-pendiente es importante. Para una línea que pasa por con pendiente , sabemos que su ecuación es . En la Figura , vemos que la línea pasa por junto con un punto arbitrario , lo que hace que el cambio vertical entre los dos puntos esté dado por y el cambio horizontal entre los puntos . Esto es consistente con el hecho de que . De hecho, escribir es una reorganización de la forma punto-pendiente de la línea, .  Usamos naturalmente los términos creciente y decreciente como en la Definición para describir las líneas según si su pendiente es positiva o negativa. Una línea con pendiente positiva, como la que se muestra en la Figura , es creciente porque su tasa de cambio constante es positiva, mientras que una línea con pendiente negativa, como en la Figura , es decreciente debido a su tasa de cambio negativa. Decimos que una línea horizontal (una cuya pendiente es ) no es ni creciente ni decreciente.    La forma punto-pendiente de la ecuación de una línea.     La forma pendiente-intercepto de la ecuación de una línea.     Un caso especial surge cuando el punto conocido en una línea satisface . En esta situación, el punto conocido se encuentra en el eje , y por lo tanto llamamos a este punto el -intercepto de la línea. línea -intercepto La forma resultante de la ecuación de la línea se llama forma pendiente-intercepto , que también se demuestra en la Figura .   Slope-intercept form  line slope-intercept form  Para la línea con pendiente y que pasa por , su ecuación es .   La forma pendiente-intercepto se deriva de la forma punto-pendiente por el hecho de que al reemplazar con obtenemos . En muchos libros de texto, la forma pendiente-intercepto de una línea (a menudo escrita ) se trata como si fuera la forma más útil de una línea. La forma punto-pendiente es en realidad más importante y valiosa, ya que podemos escribir fácilmente la ecuación de una línea tan pronto como sepamos su pendiente y cualquier punto que se encuentre en ella, en lugar de necesitar encontrar el -intercepto, que se necesita para la forma pendiente-intercepto. Además, la forma punto-pendiente juega un papel prominente en el cálculo.  Si una línea está en forma pendiente-intercepto o punto-pendiente, es útil poder interpretar rápidamente información clave sobre la línea a partir de la forma de su ecuación.    Para la línea dada por , determina su pendiente y un punto que se encuentra en la línea.   Solución . Esta línea está en forma punto-pendiente. Su pendiente es y un punto en la línea es .      Para la línea dada por , determina su pendiente y un punto que se encuentra en la línea.   Solución . Esta línea está en forma pendiente-intercepto. Su pendiente es y un punto en la línea es , que también es el -intercepto de la línea.      Interpretación de funciones lineales en contexto  Dado que las funciones lineales se definen por la propiedad de que su tasa de cambio promedio es constante, las funciones lineales modelan perfectamente cantidades que cambian a una tasa constante. En contexto, a menudo podemos pensar en la pendiente como una tasa de cambio; analizar las unidades cuidadosamente a menudo produce una visión significativa.    La función de Dolbear de la Sección es una función lineal cuya pendiente es . ¿Cuál es el significado de la pendiente en este contexto?    Recuerda que se mide en grados Fahrenheit y en chirridos por minuto. Sabemos que es la tasa de cambio promedio constante de . Sus unidades son unidades de salida por unidad de entrada , y por lo tanto grados Fahrenheit por chirrido por minuto . Esto nos dice que la tasa de cambio promedio de la función de temperatura es grados Fahrenheit por chirrido por minuto, lo que significa que por cada chirrido adicional por minuto observado, esperamos que la temperatura aumente en grados Fahrenheit.   De hecho, podemos observar esto a través de los valores de la función. Notamos que y : un chirrido adicional observado por minuto corresponde a un aumento de grados en la temperatura. También vemos esto en la gráfica de la línea, como se ve en la Figura : la pendiente entre los puntos y es .   La función lineal de Dolbear con pendiente grados Fahrenheit por chirrido por minuto.       Al igual que con la función de Dolbear, a menudo es útil escribir una función lineal (cuyo resultado se llama ) que modela una cantidad que cambia a una tasa constante (como una función de alguna entrada ) escribiendo la relación de la función en la forma donde y son constantes. Podemos pensar en las cuatro cantidades involucradas de la siguiente manera:     La constante es el valor inicial del resultado que corresponde a una entrada de ;    La constante es la tasa a la que cambia el resultado con respecto a los cambios en la entrada: por cada cambio adicional de unidad en la entrada, el resultado cambiará en unidades.    La variable es la variable independiente (entrada). Un valor distinto de cero para corresponde a cuánto ha cambiado la variable de entrada desde un valor inicial de .    La variable es la variable dependiente (salida). El valor de resulta de una elección particular de , y se puede pensar como el valor inicial de salida ( ) más el cambio en la salida que resulta del correspondiente cambio en la entrada .       La cumbre del pico más alto de África, el Monte Kilimanjaro El contexto principal de este problema proviene del Ejercicio 30 en la página 27 del libro de Connally Functions Modeling Change , 5ta edición. , tiene dos campos de hielo principales y un glaciar en su pico. Los geólogos midieron la cobertura de hielo en el año 2000 ( ) en aproximadamente m ; en el año 2007, la cobertura de hielo se midió en m .     Supongamos que la cantidad de cobertura de hielo en la cumbre del Monte Kilimanjaro está cambiando a una tasa promedio constante de un año a otro. Encuentra un modelo lineal cuyo resultado sea el área de la cobertura de hielo, , en metros cuadrados en el año (donde es el número de años después del 2000).    ¿Qué significan la pendiente y la intersección en el modelo que encontraste en (a)? En particular, ¿cuáles son las unidades de la pendiente?    Calcula . ¿Qué mide esta cantidad? Escribe una oración completa para explicar.    Si el modelo se mantiene en el futuro, ¿cuándo predicimos que desaparecerá la cobertura de hielo?    A la luz de tu trabajo anterior, ¿cuál es un dominio razonable para usar en el modelo ? ¿Cuál es el rango correspondiente?                 En cada uno de los siguientes ejercicios, investigamos funciones lineales en contexto.     La población de una ciudad inicialmente tiene personas presentes y luego crece a una tasa constante de personas por año. Encuentra un modelo lineal para el número de personas en la ciudad en el año .    La población de otra ciudad está dada por la función . ¿Cuál es la pendiente de esta función y qué significa en el modelo? Escribe una oración completa para explicar.    Un tanque esférico se está drenando con una bomba. Inicialmente el tanque está lleno con pies cúbicos de agua. Supón que el tanque se drena a una tasa constante de pies cúbicos por minuto. Encuentra un modelo lineal para la cantidad total de agua en el tanque en el tiempo . Además, ¿cuál es un dominio aproximado razonable para el modelo?    Un tanque cónico se está llenando de tal manera que la altura del agua en el tanque, (en pies), en el tiempo (en minutos) está dada por la función . ¿Qué puedes decir sobre cómo está subiendo el nivel del agua? Escribe al menos una oración cuidadosa para explicar.    Supongamos que sabemos que el valor de un coche de años es $ , y que después de años su valor es $ . Suponiendo que el valor del coche se deprecia linealmente, encuentra una función cuyo resultado sea el valor del coche en el año . ¿Cuál es un dominio razonable para el modelo? ¿Cuál es el valor y el significado de la pendiente de la línea? Escribe al menos una oración cuidadosa para explicar.                 Resumen     Cualquier función con dominio en todos los números reales que tenga una tasa de cambio promedio constante en cada intervalo tendrá una gráfica en línea recta. Llamamos a tales funciones funciones lineales .    Una función lineal puede escribirse en la forma , donde es la pendiente de la línea y es un punto que se encuentra en la línea. En particular, .    En un contexto aplicado donde tenemos una función lineal que modela un fenómeno en el mundo que nos rodea, la pendiente nos indica la tasa de cambio promedio (constante) de la función. Las unidades de la pendiente, , son siempre unidades de salida por unidad de entrada y esto nos permite articular cómo cambia la salida en respuesta a un cambio de unidad en la entrada.

(b) means water is entering the reservoir at 450 gallons per second at time seconds. (c) The vertical intercept first tells us that at time seconds, the water is initially flowing in at the rate of 600 gallons per second. The horizontal intercept tells us that at seconds, the flow has stopped. The slope is . This means that the rate at which water enters the reservoir decreases by 30 gallons per second each second. The water is flowing in at a decreasing rate. (d) The reservoir has more and more water when the rate, , is positive because water is being added. Water is being added until seconds later when it starts flowing out. This means at , the most water is in the reservoir. (e) The reservoir has water draining out between and , but this amount is not as much as the water that entered between and . Thus, the reservoir had the least amount of water at the beginning when . Remember the function gives the rate of flow, not the amount of water in the reservoir. (f) If the domain is specified as , then the rate varies from 600 gallons per second at to -300 gallons per second at , so the range is . In interval notation we express the range as .

Si es así, hazlo; si no, explica por qué no.               Debido a que las funciones cuadráticas nos son familiares, repetiremos rápidamente algunas de sus propiedades importantes conocidas.   Soluciones para  quadratic formula  Sean , y números reales con . La ecuación puede tener , o soluciones reales. Estas soluciones reales están dadas por la fórmula cuadrática, , siempre que .   Como podemos ver en Figura , al desplazar la gráfica de una función cuadrática verticalmente, podemos hacer que su gráfica cruce el eje  veces (como en la gráfica de ), exactamente vez ( ), o dos veces ( ). Estos puntos son las intersecciones con el eje de la gráfica.    Tres ejemplos de funciones cuadráticas que se abren hacia arriba.     Un ejemplo de una función cuadrática que se abre hacia abajo.     Aunque la fórmula cuadrática siempre proporcionará cualquier solución real a , en la práctica a menudo es más fácil intentar factorizar antes de usar la fórmula. Por ejemplo, dado , podemos encontrar sus intersecciones con el eje rápidamente mediante factorización. Dado que , se sigue que y son las intersecciones con el eje de . Note en términos más generales que si conocemos las intersecciones con el eje  quadratic function  x-intercepts de una función cuadrática que son y , se sigue que podemos escribir la función cuadrática en la forma .  Toda función cuadrática tiene una intersección con el eje ; quadratic function  y-intercept para una función de la forma , la intersección con el eje es el punto , como se demuestra en Figura .  Además, toda función cuadrática tiene una gráfica simétrica que siempre se curva hacia arriba o siempre se curva hacia abajo. La gráfica se abre hacia arriba si y solo si y se abre hacia abajo si y solo si . A menudo llamamos a la gráfica de una función cuadrática una parábola . parabola Toda parábola es simétrica respecto a una línea vertical que pasa por su punto más bajo o más alto.   El vértice de una parábola  parabola vertex  quadratic function vertex  La función cuadrática tiene su vértice en el punto . Cuando , el vértice es el punto más bajo en la gráfica de , mientras que si , el vértice es el punto más alto. Además, la gráfica de es simétrica respecto a la línea vertical .     El vértice de una función cuadrática que se abre hacia arriba.     El vértice de una función cuadrática que se abre hacia abajo.     Nota en particular que, debido a la simetría, el vértice de una función cuadrática se encuentra a medio camino entre sus intersecciones con el eje (siempre que la función tenga intersecciones con el eje ). En ambas Figuras y , vemos cómo la parábola es simétrica respecto a la línea vertical que pasa por el vértice. Una forma de entender esta simetría puede verse escribiendo una función cuadrática dada en una forma algebraica diferente.    Considera la función cuadrática en forma estándar dada por . Determina las constantes , y para que , y así determina el vértice de . ¿Cómo explica esta forma alternativa de la simetría en su gráfica?    Primero observamos que podemos escribir en una forma más cercana a factorizando de los dos primeros términos para obtener . A continuación, queremos agregar una constante dentro del paréntesis para formar un cuadrado perfecto. Observando que , necesitamos agregar . Dado que estamos agregando dentro del paréntesis, el se está multiplicando por , lo que tiene el efecto neto de agregar a la función. Para mantener la función tal como está, también debemos restar , y así tenemos . Se sigue que .  A continuación, observa que el vértice de es . Esto se cumple porque es siempre mayor o igual a , y por lo tanto su valor más pequeño posible es cuando . Además, cuando , . También podemos verificar que este punto es el vértice usando la forma estándar. De , vemos que y , por lo que . Además, .   Finalmente, la forma explica la simetría de respecto a la línea . Considera los dos puntos que se encuentran equidistantes de en el eje , a una distancia de unidades: y . Observa que para estos valores, Dado que para cualquier elección de , esto muestra que la parábola es simétrica respecto a la línea vertical que pasa por su vértice.    En Example , vimos algunas de las ventajas de escribir una función cuadrática en la forma . Llamamos a esta la forma de vértice de una función cuadrática.   Forma de vértice de una función cuadrática  quadratic function vertex form  Una función cuadrática con vértice puede escribirse en la forma . La constante puede determinarse a partir de otro valor de la función para una entrada .

Razonando algebraicamente, determina los valores exactos de dichas intersecciones o explica por qué no existen.                 Modelando objetos en caída  Una de las razones por las que las funciones cuadráticas son tan importantes es debido a un hecho físico del universo que habitamos: para un objeto influenciado solo por la gravedad, gravity  la aceleración debido a la gravedad es constante . Si medimos el tiempo en segundos y la altura de un objeto que sube o cae en pies, la constante gravitacional es pies por segundo por segundo.  Una de las fantásticas consecuencias del cálculo que, al igual que la realización de que la aceleración debido a la gravedad es constante, se debe en gran parte a Sir Isaac Newton a finales de los años 1600 es que la altura de un objeto en caída en el tiempo se modela mediante una función cuadrática.   Altura de un objeto en caída bajo la fuerza de la gravedad  gravity falling object  Para un objeto lanzado verticalmente desde una altura inicial de pies con una velocidad de pies por segundo, la altura del objeto en el tiempo (en segundos) está dada por la fórmula    Si la altura se mide en metros y la velocidad en metros por segundo, la constante gravitacional es y la función tiene la forma . gravity gravitational constant (Cuando la altura se mide en pies, la constante gravitacional es .)    Un globo de agua es lanzado verticalmente desde una ventana a una altura inicial de 37 pies y con una velocidad inicial de 41 pies por segundo.     Determina una fórmula, , para la función que modela la altura del globo de agua en el tiempo .    Grafica la función en Desmos en una ventana apropiada.    Usa la gráfica para estimar el tiempo en que el globo de agua aterriza.    Usa álgebra para encontrar el tiempo exacto en que el globo de agua aterriza.

Incluye unidades en tus respuestas y escribe una oración para explicar el significado de los valores que encontraste. Dibuja líneas apropiadas en la gráfica de cuyas pendientes respectivas sean los valores de estas tasas de cambio promedio.                 Cómo cambian las funciones cuadráticas  Hasta ahora, hemos visto que las funciones cuadráticas tienen muchas propiedades interesantes. En Preview Activity , descubrimos un patrón adicional que es particularmente notable.  Recuerda que consideramos un globo de agua lanzado verticalmente desde la ventana de un quinto piso cuya altura, , en metros, en el tiempo , en segundos, se modela Aquí estamos usando en lugar de por simplicidad. mediante la función . Luego completamos Table y Table para investigar cómo variaban tanto los valores de la función como las tasas de cambio promedio a medida que cambiábamos la entrada a la función.    Valores de la función para en entradas seleccionadas.                                  Tasas de cambio promedio para en intervalos seleccionados .         m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s         En la Tabla , vemos un patrón interesante en las velocidades promedio de la pelota. De hecho, si eliminamos la notación y nos centramos en el valor inicial de cada intervalo, viendo la tasa de cambio promedio resultante, , como una función del valor inicial, podemos considerar la tabla relacionada vista en Table , donde es evidente que es una función lineal de .    Datos de Table , ligeramente reformulados.         m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s     m\/s      Gráfica de junto con segmentos de línea cuyas pendientes corresponden a tasas de cambio promedio.     De hecho, al ver estos datos gráficamente como en Figure , observamos que la tasa de cambio promedio de está cambiando de una manera que parece estar representada por una función lineal. Aunque se necesitan ideas clave del cálculo para formalizar esta observación, por ahora simplemente notaremos que para una función cuadrática parece haber una función lineal relacionada que nos dice algo sobre cómo cambia la función cuadrática. Además, también podemos decir que en la función cuadrática que se abre hacia abajo, su tasa de cambio promedio parece estar disminuyendo a medida que nos movemos de izquierda a derecha Siempre y cuando consideremos la tasa de cambio promedio en intervalos de la misma longitud. Nuevamente, se necesitan ideas del cálculo para hacer esta observación completamente precisa. .  Una observación clave para concluir aquí es que el hecho de que la parábola se doble hacia abajo está aparentemente conectado con el hecho de que su tasa de cambio promedio disminuye a medida que nos movemos de izquierda a derecha. Por el contrario, para una función cuadrática que se dobla hacia arriba , podemos mostrar que su tasa de cambio promedio aumenta a medida que nos movemos de izquierda a derecha (ver Exercise ). Además, también vemos que es posible ver la tasa de cambio promedio de una función en intervalos de unidad como una función en sí misma: un proceso que relaciona una entrada (el valor inicial del intervalo) con una salida correspondiente (la tasa de cambio promedio de la función original en el intervalo resultante de unidad).  Para cualquier función que se doble consistentemente hacia arriba exclusivamente o hacia abajo exclusivamente en un intervalo dado , usamos el siguiente lenguaje formal Se necesita cálculo para hacer Definition riguroso y preciso. para describirla.   function trends concave up  function trends concave down   Si una función siempre se dobla hacia arriba en un intervalo , decimos que es cóncava hacia arriba en . De manera similar, si siempre se dobla hacia abajo en un intervalo , decimos que es cóncava hacia abajo en .    Así, ahora llamamos a una función cuadrática con  cóncava hacia arriba , mientras que si decimos que es cóncava hacia abajo .    Resumen     Las funciones cuadráticas (de la forma con ) no son lineales en absoluto: su tasa de cambio promedio no es constante, sino que depende del intervalo elegido. Al mismo tiempo, las funciones cuadráticas parecen cambiar de una manera muy regimentada: si calculamos la tasa de cambio promedio en varios intervalos consecutivos de unidad, parece que la tasa de cambio promedio en sí misma cambia a una tasa constante. Las funciones cuadráticas se doblan hacia arriba ( ) o se doblan hacia abajo ( ) y estas formas están conectadas a si la tasa de cambio promedio en intervalos consecutivos de unidad disminuye o aumenta a medida que nos movemos de izquierda a derecha.    Para un objeto con altura medida en pies en el tiempo en segundos, si el objeto fue lanzado verticalmente a una velocidad inicial de pies por segundo y desde una altura inicial de pies, la altura del objeto está dada por . Es decir, la altura del objeto está completamente determinada por la altura inicial y la velocidad inicial desde la cual fue lanzado. El modelo es válido durante todo el tiempo hasta que el objeto aterriza. Si se mide en metros y en metros por segundo, se reemplaza por .    Una función cuadrática puede escribirse en una de tres formas familiares: estándar, de vértice o factorizada No siempre es posible escribir una función cuadrática en forma factorizada involucrando solo números reales; esto solo puede hacerse si tiene o intersecciones con el eje . .

  "body": " Funciones Compuestas     ¿Cómo produce el proceso de composición de funciones una nueva función a partir de otras dos funciones?    En la función compuesta , ¿qué queremos decir con la función interna y la función externa ? ¿Qué papel juegan el dominio y el codominio de y en la determinación del dominio y el codominio de ?    ¿Cómo implica una función compuesta la expresión para ?      Recuerda que una función, por definición, es un proceso que toma una colección de entradas y produce una colección correspondiente de salidas de tal manera que el proceso produce un único valor de salida para cualquier valor de entrada. Dado que cada función es un proceso, tiene sentido pensar que puede ser posible tomar dos procesos de funciones y hacer uno de los procesos primero, y luego aplicar el segundo proceso al resultado.    Supongamos que sabemos que es una función de según el proceso definido por y, a su vez, es una función de a través de . ¿Es posible combinar estos procesos para generar una nueva función de modo que sea una función de ?    Dado que depende de y depende de , se deduce que también podemos pensar que depende directamente de . Podemos usar la sustitución y la notación de funciones para determinar esta relación.  Primero, es importante darse cuenta de lo que nos dice la regla para . En palabras, dice para generar la salida que corresponde a una entrada, tome la entrada, elévela al cuadrado y luego reste . En símbolos, podríamos expresar más generalmente escribiendo .   Ahora, observando que y que , podemos sustituir la expresión por en . Haciendo esto, . Aplicando el proceso definido por la función a la entrada , vemos que , lo cual define como una función de .    Cuando tenemos una situación como en Example donde usamos la salida de una función como la entrada de otra, a menudo decimos que hemos compuesto dos funciones . Además, utilizamos la notación para denotar que una nueva función, , resulta de componer las dos funciones y .    Sea y .     Sea . Determina una fórmula para que dependa solo de y no de o .    Recuerda el Ejemplo , que involucraba funciones similares a y . ¿Cuál es la mayor diferencia entre su trabajo en (a) anterior y en Example ?    Sea y recuerda que . Determina una fórmula para que dependa solo de .    Supón que . Determina fórmulas para dos funciones relacionadas, y , de modo que .         Componiendo dos funciones  Cuando tenemos dos funciones, digamos y , donde el codominio de coincide con el dominio de , es posible enlazar los dos procesos para crear un nuevo proceso que llamamos la composición de y .   composite function   Si y son funciones tales que y , definimos la composición de y como la nueva función dada por . A veces también usamos la notación , donde es la función única definida por .    A veces llamamos a la función interna y a la función externa . Es importante notar que la función interna es realmente la primera función que se aplica a un input dado, y luego la función externa se aplica al output de la función interna. Además, para que una función compuesta tenga sentido, necesitamos asegurarnos de que el rango de la función interna esté dentro del dominio de la función externa para que la función compuesta resultante esté definida en cada input posible.  Además de la posibilidad de que las funciones se den mediante fórmulas, las funciones pueden darse mediante tablas o gráficos. También podemos pensar en funciones compuestas en estos contextos, y las siguientes actividades nos invitan a considerar funciones dadas de esta manera.    Sean las funciones y dadas por los gráficos en Figura (los cuales son cada uno lineales a trozos, es decir, partes que parecen líneas rectas son líneas rectas) y las funciones y dadas por la Tabla .    Tabla que define y .     0  1  2  3  4     6  4  3  4  6     1  3  0  4  2      Los gráficos de y .     Calcula cada una de las siguientes cantidades o explica por qué no están definidas.                                 ¿Para qué valor(es) de se cumple que ?    ¿Para qué valor(es) de se cumple que ?                 Composing functions in context  Recuerda la función de Dolbear, , que relaciona el número de chirridos por minuto de un grillo de nieve con la temperatura en Fahrenheit, . Anteriormente establecimos que tiene un dominio de y un rango correspondiente de . En lo que sigue, reemplazamos con para enfatizar que la temperatura se mide en grados Fahrenheit.  Las escalas de temperatura Celsius y Fahrenheit están conectadas por una función lineal. De hecho, la función que convierte Fahrenheit a Celsius es . Por ejemplo, una temperatura de grados Fahrenheit corresponde a grados Celsius.    Sea la función de Dolbear que convierte un input de número de chirridos por minuto a grados Fahrenheit, y sea la función que convierte un input de grados Fahrenheit a un output de grados Celsius.     Determina una fórmula para la nueva función que dependa solo de la variable .    ¿Cuál es el significado de la función que encontraste en (a)?    ¿Cómo se compara un gráfico de la función con el de la función de Dolbear? Dibuja un gráfico de en los ejes en blanco a la derecha del gráfico de la función de Dolbear, y discute las similitudes y diferencias entre ellos. Asegúrate de etiquetar la escala vertical en tus ejes.    Función de Dolbear     Ejes en blanco para graficar .       ¿Cuál es el dominio de la función ? ¿Cuál es su rango?                 Composición de funciones y tasa de cambio promedio  Recuerda que la tasa de cambio promedio de una función en el intervalo se da por . En la Figura , vemos la representación familiar de como la pendiente de la línea que une los puntos y en el gráfico de . En el estudio del cálculo, progresamos de la tasa de cambio promedio en un intervalo a la tasa de cambio instantánea de una función en un solo valor ; la idea central que nos permite pasar de una tasa promedio a una instantánea es dejar que el intervalo se reduzca en tamaño.    is the slope of the line joining the points and on the graph of .     es la pendiente de la línea que une los puntos y en el gráfico de .     Para pensar en el intervalo reduciéndose mientras permanece fijo, a menudo cambiamos nuestra perspectiva y pensamos en como , donde mide la diferencia horizontal de a . Esto nos permite eventualmente pensar en acercándose cada vez más a (sin llegar a ser igual a ), y en ese contexto consideramos la expresión equivalente para la tasa de cambio promedio de en .  En esta expresión más reciente para , vemos el papel importante que juega la función compuesta . En particular, para entender la expresión para necesitamos evaluar en la cantidad .    Supón que . Determina la expresión más simple posible que puedas encontrar para , la tasa de cambio promedio de en el intervalo .    Por definición, sabemos que Usando la fórmula para , vemos que Expandiendo el numerador y combinando términos semejantes, se sigue que . Eliminando un factor de en el numerador y observando que , podemos simplificar y encontrar que . Por lo tanto, , que es la tasa de cambio promedio de en el intervalo . Nota que es una función lineal de . Este cálculo está relacionado con la observación que hicimos en la Tabla sobre cómo hay un aspecto lineal en cómo la tasa de cambio promedio de una función cuadrática cambia a medida que modificamos el intervalo.       Sea y .     Calcula y expande y simplifica el resultado tanto como sea posible combinando términos semejantes.    Determina la expresión más simplificada posible para la tasa de cambio promedio de en el intervalo . Es decir, determina para y simplifica el resultado tanto como sea posible.    Calcula . ¿Hay algún álgebra válida que puedas hacer para escribir de manera más simple?    Determina la expresión más simplificada posible para la tasa de cambio promedio de en el intervalo . Es decir, determina para y simplifica el resultado.               En la Actividad , vemos un escenario importante donde la simplificación algebraica juega un papel crucial en el cálculo. Porque la expresión siempre comienza con un en el denominador, para entender con precisión cómo se comporta esta cantidad cuando se acerca a , se necesita una versión simplificada de esta expresión. Por ejemplo, como encontramos en la parte (b) de la Actividad , es posible mostrar que para , , lo cual es una expresión mucho más simple de investigar.    Resumen     Cuando está definida, la composición de dos funciones y produce una nueva función según la regla . Observamos que se aplica primero al input , y luego se aplica al output que resulta de .    En la función compuesta , la función interna es y la función externa es . Nota que la función interna se aplica a primero, aunque la función externa aparezca primero cuando leemos de izquierda a derecha. La función compuesta solo está definida siempre que el codominio de coincida con el dominio de : es decir, necesitamos que cualquier output posible de esté entre los inputs permitidos para . En particular, podemos decir que si y , entonces . Así, el dominio de la función compuesta es el dominio de la función interna, y el codominio de la función compuesta es el codominio de la función externa.    Porque la expresión se define por y esto incluye la cantidad , la tasa de cambio promedio de una función en el intervalo siempre implica la evaluación de una expresión de función compuesta. Esta idea juega un papel crucial en el estudio del cálculo.         Suppose is the radius, in centimeters, of a circle at time minutes, and is the area, in square centimeters, of a circle of radius centimeters.  Which of the following statements best explains the meaning of the composite function ?    The area of a circle, in square centimeters, of radius centimeters.    The area of a circle, in square centimeters, at time minutes.    The radius of a circle, in centimeters, at time minutes.    The function of the minutes and the area.    None of the above     SOLUTION  is the area, in square centimeters, of the circle at time minutes.        A swinging pendulum is constructed from a piece of string with a weight attached to the bottom. The length of the pendulum depends on how much string is let out.

Cuando una función tiene una función inversa, ¿qué propiedades importantes tiene la función inversa en comparación con la función original?      Dado que cada función es un proceso que convierte una colección de entradas en una colección correspondiente de salidas, una pregunta natural es: para una función particular, ¿podemos cambiar de perspectiva y pensar en las salidas de la función original como las entradas para un proceso inverso? Si formulamos esta pregunta algebraicamente, es análogo a preguntar: dada una ecuación que define como una función de , ¿es posible encontrar una ecuación correspondiente donde sea una función de ?    Recuerda que es la función que toma entradas de temperatura en Celsius y produce las salidas correspondientes en Fahrenheit.     Muestra que es posible resolver la ecuación para en términos de y que al hacerlo se obtiene la ecuación .    Nota que la ecuación expresa como una función de . Llama a esta función de modo que .  Encuentra la expresión más simple que puedas para la función compuesta .    Encuentra la expresión más simple que puedas para la función compuesta .    ¿Por qué son tan simples las funciones y ? Explica discutiendo cómo las funciones y procesan entradas para generar salidas y qué sucede cuando ejecutamos primero una y luego la otra.         Cuando una función tiene una función inversa  En Actividad de Previsualización , encontramos que para la función , también es posible resolver para en términos de y escribir . La primera función, , convierte temperaturas en Celsius a Fahrenheit; la segunda función, , convierte temperaturas en Fahrenheit a Celsius. Por lo tanto, el proceso invierte el proceso de , y de la misma manera el proceso de invierte el proceso de . Esto también es la razón por la cual tiene sentido que y . Si, por ejemplo, tomamos una temperatura en Celsius , la convertimos a Fahrenheit y luego convertimos el resultado de vuelta a Celsius, llegamos nuevamente a la temperatura en Celsius con la que empezamos: .  Un trabajo similar es a veces posible con otras funciones. Cuando podemos encontrar una nueva función que invierte el proceso de la función original, decimos que la función original tiene una función inversa y hacemos la siguiente definición formal.   inverse function definition   Sea una función. Si existe una función tal que para cada en y cada en , entonces decimos que tiene una función inversa y que la función es la inversa de .    Nota particularmente lo que dice la ecuación : para cualquier entrada en el dominio de , la función invertirá el proceso de (que convierte en ) porque convierte de vuelta a .  Cuando una función dada tiene una función inversa correspondiente , usualmente renombramos como , que leemos en voz alta como -inversa . inverse function notation La ecuación ahora se lee , lo que interpretamos como decir -inversa convierte de vuelta a . De manera similar, escribimos que .    Recuerda la función de Dolbear que convierte el número, , de chirridos por minuto del grillo de árbol nevado a una temperatura correspondiente en Fahrenheit. Hemos establecido anteriormente que el dominio de es y el rango de es , como se ve en la Figura .     Resuelve la ecuación para en términos de . Llama a la función resultante .    Explica en palabras el proceso o efecto de la función . ¿Qué toma como entrada? ¿Qué genera como salida?    Usa la función que encontraste en (a.) para calcular . Simplifica tu resultado tanto como sea posible. Haz lo mismo para . ¿Qué notas acerca de estas dos funciones compuestas y ?    Considera las ecuaciones y . ¿Estas ecuaciones expresan diferentes relaciones entre y , o expresan la misma relación de dos maneras diferentes? Explica.               Cuando una función dada tiene una función inversa, nos permite expresar la misma relación desde dos puntos de vista diferentes. Por ejemplo, si , podemos mostrar Observa que . De manera similar, . que la función invierte el efecto de (y viceversa), y por lo tanto . Observamos que son formas equivalentes de la misma ecuación, y por lo tanto dicen lo mismo desde dos perspectivas diferentes. La primera versión de la ecuación está resuelta para en términos de , mientras que la segunda ecuación está resuelta para en términos de . Este principio importante se mantiene en general siempre que una función tiene una función inversa.   Dos perspectivas desde una función y su función inversa  inverse function two perspectives  Si tiene una función inversa, entonces las ecuaciones dicen exactamente lo mismo pero desde dos perspectivas diferentes.     Determinando si una función tiene una función inversa  Es importante notar en Definición que decimos Si existe . Es decir, no garantizamos que una función inversa exista para una función dada. Por lo tanto, podríamos preguntar: ¿cómo podemos determinar si una función dada tiene una función inversa correspondiente? Como con muchas preguntas sobre funciones, a menudo hay tres formas diferentes de explorar tal pregunta: a través de una tabla, a través de un gráfico o a través de una fórmula algebraica.    ¿Tienen las funciones y definidas por Tabla y Tabla funciones inversas correspondientes? ¿Por qué o por qué no?    La tabla que define la función .                      La tabla que define la función .                        Para cualquier función, la cuestión de si tiene o no una inversa se reduce a si el proceso de la función puede ser invertido de manera confiable. Para funciones dadas en forma de tabla, como y , esencialmente preguntamos si es posible intercambiar las filas de entrada y salida y que la nueva tabla resultante también represente una función.  La función no tiene una función inversa porque hay dos entradas diferentes que llevan al mismo resultado: y . Si intentamos invertir este proceso, tenemos una situación donde la entrada correspondería a dos posibles salidas, y .  Sin embargo, la función sí tiene una función inversa porque cuando invertimos las filas en Tabla , cada entrada (en orden, , , , , ) corresponde a una y solo una salida (en orden, , , , , ). Así podemos hacer observaciones como , lo cual es lo mismo que decir que , solo desde una perspectiva diferente.    En Ejemplo , vemos que si podemos identificar un par de entradas distintas que llevan al mismo resultado (como en Tabla ), entonces el proceso de la función no puede ser invertido y la función no tiene una inversa.    ¿Tienen las funciones y definidas por Figura y Figura funciones inversas correspondientes? ¿Por qué o por qué no?    El gráfico que define la función .     El gráfico que define la función .       Recuerda que cuando un punto como se encuentra en el gráfico de una función , esto significa que la entrada , que representa un valor en el eje horizontal, corresponde con la salida que está representada por un valor en el eje vertical. En esta situación, escribimos . Explicitamos que es una función porque su gráfico pasa la : cualquier línea vertical intersecta el gráfico de exactamente una vez, y por lo tanto cada entrada del dominio corresponde a una y solo una salida.  Si intentamos cambiar de perspectiva y usar el gráfico de para ver como una función de , vemos que esto falla porque el valor de salida está asociado con dos entradas diferentes, y . Dicho de otra manera, debido a que la línea horizontal intersecta el gráfico de en ambos puntos y (como se muestra en la Figura ), no podemos ver como la entrada a un proceso de función que produce el valor correspondiente de . Por lo tanto, no tiene una función inversa.  Por otro lado, siempre y cuando el comportamiento visto en la figura continúe, la función sí tiene una inversa porque podemos ver como una función de a través del gráfico dado en la Figura . Esto se debe a que para cualquier elección de , corresponde un y solo un que resulta de . Podemos pensar en esto visualmente comenzando en un valor como en el eje , moviéndonos horizontalmente hasta donde la línea intersecta el gráfico de , y luego moviéndonos hacia abajo hasta la ubicación correspondiente (aquí ) en el eje horizontal. Del comportamiento del gráfico de (una línea recta que siempre está aumentando), vemos que esta correspondencia se mantendrá para cualquier elección de , y por lo tanto es una función de . A partir de esto, podemos decir que sí tiene una función inversa. Así, podemos escribir que , lo cual es una manera diferente de expresar el hecho equivalente de que .    Las observaciones gráficas que hicimos para la función en Ejemplo proporcionan una prueba general para determinar si una función dada por un gráfico tiene una función inversa correspondiente.   Prueba de la Línea Horizontal  inverse function horizontal line test  Una función cuyo gráfico se encuentra en el plano - tiene una función inversa correspondiente si y solo si cada línea horizontal intersecta el gráfico a lo sumo una vez. Cuando el gráfico pasa esta prueba, la coordenada horizontal de cada punto en el gráfico puede ser vista como una función de la coordenada vertical del punto.     ¿Tienen las funciones y definidas por funciones inversas correspondientes? Si no, usa razonamiento algebraico para explicar por qué; si es así, demuestra usando álgebra para encontrar una fórmula para la función inversa.    Para cualquier función de la forma , una forma de determinar si podemos ver la variable de entrada original como una función de la variable de salida original es intentar resolver la ecuación para en términos de .  Tomando , intentamos resolver para primero restando de ambos lados para obtener . Luego, multiplicando ambos lados por , se sigue que . Dado que la función de raíz cúbica tiene la propiedad de que para cada número real (ya que la función de raíz cúbica es la función inversa de la función de cubo, y cada función tiene tanto un dominio como un rango de todos los números reales), podemos tomar la raíz cúbica de ambos lados de la ecuación anterior para obtener . Finalmente, sumando a ambos lados, hemos determinado que . Dado que hemos podido expresar como una única función de para cada valor posible de , esto muestra que efectivamente tiene una inversa y que .  Intentamos un razonamiento similar para la segunda función, . Para resolver para , primero restamos de ambos lados, de modo que . Después de multiplicar ambos lados por , tenemos . Después, es necesario tomar la raíz cuadrada de ambos lados en un esfuerzo por aislar . Aquí, sin embargo, encontramos un problema crucial. Debido a que la función lleva cualquier número distinto de cero y su opuesto al mismo resultado (por ejemplo, ), esto significa que tenemos que considerar ambas entradas posibles que resultan en el mismo resultado. Basándonos en nuestra última ecuación, esto significa que o bien . Por lo tanto, encontramos no una sola ecuación que exprese como una función de , sino dos: . Dado que parece que no puede expresarse como una única función de , parece seguir que no tiene una función inversa.    Las gráficas de y proporcionan una perspectiva diferente para confirmar los resultados de Ejemplo . De hecho, en Figura , vemos que parece pasar la prueba de la línea horizontal porque está decreciendo El cálculo proporciona una forma de justificar completamente que la gráfica de está efectivamente siempre decreciendo. , y por lo tanto tiene una función inversa. Por otro lado, la gráfica de no pasa la prueba de la línea horizontal (imagina la línea en Figura ) y, por lo tanto, no tiene una función inversa.    Una gráfica de .     Una gráfica de .       Determina, con justificación, si cada una de las siguientes funciones tiene una función inversa. Para cada función que tenga una función inversa, da dos ejemplos de valores de la función inversa escribiendo declaraciones como .     La función dada por Tabla , donde .

La gráfica de .                    Propiedades de una función inversa  Cuando una función tiene una función inversa, hemos observado varias relaciones importantes que se mantienen entre la función original y la función inversa correspondiente.   Propiedades de una función inversa  Sea una función cuyo dominio es y cuyo rango es tal que tiene una función inversa, . Entonces:      , por lo tanto, el dominio de es y su rango es .    Las funciones y invierten los procesos una de la otra. Simbólicamente, para cada entrada en el dominio de , y de manera similar, para cada entrada en el dominio de .    Si , entonces podemos expresar la misma relación desde una perspectiva diferente escribiendo .    Considera el escenario donde y son colecciones de números reales. Si un punto se encuentra en la gráfica de , entonces se sigue que . Desde esto, podemos decir de manera equivalente que . Por lo tanto, el punto se encuentra en la gráfica de .      El último punto mencionado lleva a una relación especial entre las gráficas de y cuando se ven en los mismos ejes de coordenadas. En ese contexto, necesitamos ver como la entrada de cada función (ya que es la coordenada horizontal) y como la salida. Si conocemos una relación particular de entrada-salida para , digamos , entonces se sigue que . Observamos que los puntos y son reflejos uno del otro a través de la línea . Debido a que tal relación se mantiene para cada punto en la gráfica de , esto significa que las gráficas de y son reflejos una de la otra a través de la línea , como se ve en Figura .

Proporciona una justificación algebraica para tu respuesta.                 Resumen     Una función dada tiene una función inversa siempre que exista una función relacionada que invierta el proceso de . Formalmente, esto significa que debe satisfacer para cada en el dominio de , y para cada en el rango de .

  "body": " Transformación de Funciones     ¿Cómo se relaciona el gráfico de con el gráfico de ?    ¿Qué queremos decir con transformaciones de una función dada ? ¿Cómo son ejemplos de transformaciones las traslaciones y los estiramientos verticales de una función?      En nuestra preparación para el cálculo, aspiramos a entender las funciones desde una amplia gama de perspectivas y familiarizarnos con una biblioteca de funciones básicas. Hasta ahora, dos familias básicas de funciones que hemos considerado son las funciones lineales y las funciones cuadráticas, las más simples de las cuales son y . A medida que avancemos, nos esforzaremos por entender una función madre como el miembro más fundamental de una familia de funciones, así como cómo otras funciones similares pero más complicadas son el resultado de transformar la función madre.  Informalmente, una transformación transformation of a function de una función dada es un proceso algebraico por el cual cambiamos la función a una función relacionada que tiene la misma forma fundamental, pero que puede estar desplazada, reflejada y\/o estirada de manera sistemática. Por ejemplo, entre todas las funciones cuadráticas, la más simple es la función madre , pero cualquier otra función cuadrática, como , también puede entenderse en relación con la función madre. Decimos que es una transformación de .   En Preview Activity , investigamos los efectos de las constantes , , y en la generación de la función en el contexto de ya conocer la función .    Abre un nuevo gráfico en Desmos y define la función . Ajusta la ventana para que el rango sea y .     En Desmos , define la función . (Es decir, en Desmos en la línea 2, introduce g(x) = f(x) + a .)

Luego, investiga con los controles deslizantes , y para ver los efectos en , y (mostrándolos nuevamente según corresponda). Escribe un par de oraciones para describir tus observaciones de tus exploraciones.         Traslación de Funciones  Comenzamos resumiendo dos de nuestros hallazgos en Preview Activity .   Vertical Translation of a Function  transformation of a function vertical translation  Dada una función y un número real , la función transformada es una traslación vertical del gráfico de . Es decir, cada punto en el gráfico de se desplaza verticalmente al punto correspondiente en el gráfico de .   Como encontramos en nuestras exploraciones de Desmos en la actividad previa, es especialmente útil ver los efectos de la traslación vertical dinámicamente.   Demostración interactiva de traslaciones verticales (solo en la versión HTML).    En una traslación vertical, el gráfico de se encuentra por encima del gráfico de siempre que , mientras que el gráfico de se encuentra por debajo del gráfico de siempre que . En Figure , vemos la función original junto con la transformación resultante , que es un desplazamiento vertical hacia abajo de unidades. Nota particularmente que cada punto en el gráfico original de se mueve unidades hacia abajo; a menudo indicamos esto con una flecha y etiquetando al menos un punto clave en cada gráfico.    A vertical translation, , of the function .     A horizontal translation, , of a different function .     En Figura , vemos una traslación horizontal de la función original que desplaza su gráfica unidades a la derecha para formar la función . Observa que no es una función básica familiar; las transformaciones pueden aplicarse a cualquier función original que deseemos.  Desde un punto de vista algebraico, las traslaciones horizontales son un poco más complicadas que las verticales. Dado , si definimos la función transformada , observa que . Esto muestra que para una entrada de en , la salida de es la misma que la salida de que corresponde a una entrada de simplemente . Por lo tanto, en Figure , la fórmula para en términos de es , ya que una entrada de en resultará en la misma salida que una entrada de en . Por ejemplo, , lo cual se alinea con la gráfica de siendo un desplazamiento de la gráfica de a la derecha por unidades.  Nuevamente, es instructivo ver los efectos de la traslación horizontal de manera dinámica.   Demostración interactiva de traslaciones horizontales (solo en la versión HTML).    En general, tenemos el siguiente principio general.   Horizontal Translation of a Function  transformation of a function horizontal translation  Dada una función y un número real , la función transformada es una traslación horizontal del gráfico de . Es decir, cada punto en el gráfico de se desplaza horizontalmente al punto correspondiente en el gráfico de .   Enfatizamos que en la traslación horizontal , si el gráfico de se encuentra unidades a la derecha de , mientras que si , se encuentra unidades a la izquierda de .    Considera las funciones y dadas en Figure y Figure .    Una función madre .     Una función madre .        En los mismos ejes que la gráfica de , dibuja los siguientes gráficos: , , y . Asegúrate de etiquetar el punto en cada una de , , y que corresponde a en la gráfica original de . Además, escribe una oración para explicar las transformaciones generales que han resultado en , , y .     En los mismos ejes que la gráfica de , dibuja los siguientes gráficos: , , y . Asegúrate de etiquetar el punto en cada una de , , y que corresponde a en la gráfica original de . Además, escribe una oración para explicar las transformaciones generales que han resultado en , , y .    Ahora considera la función . Determina una fórmula para la función que se da por . ¿Cómo es una transformación de ?                 Estiramientos verticales y reflexiones  Hasta ahora, hemos visto los posibles efectos de añadir un valor constante a la salida de una función (es decir, la nueva expresión si se nos da ) y de añadir un valor constante a la entrada de una función (es decir, la nueva expresión , dada ). Cada una de estas acciones resulta en una traslación del gráfico de la función (ya sea vertical u horizontalmente), pero dejando el gráfico igual en otros aspectos. A continuación, investigamos los efectos de multiplicar la salida de la función por una constante.    Dada la función madre representada en Figure , ¿cuáles son los efectos de la transformación para varios valores de ?    Primero investigamos los efectos de y . Para , el impacto algebraico de esta transformación es que cada salida de se multiplica por . Esto significa que la única salida que no cambia es cuando , mientras que cualquier otro punto en el gráfico de la función original se estirará verticalmente alejándose del eje por un factor de . Podemos ver esto en Figure , donde cada punto en el gráfico azul oscuro original se transforma en un punto correspondiente cuyo -coordenada es dos veces más grande, como se indica parcialmente por las flechas rojas.    La función madre junto con dos estiramientos verticales diferentes, y .     La función madre junto con una reflexión vertical, , y un estiramiento correspondiente, .     En contraste, la transformación se estira verticalmente por un factor de , lo que tiene el efecto de comprimir el gráfico de hacia el eje , ya que todas las salidas de la función se multiplican por . Por ejemplo, el punto en el gráfico de se transforma en el punto en el gráfico de , y otros se transforman como se indica con las flechas moradas.  Para considerar la situación donde , primero consideramos el caso más simple donde en la transformación . Aquí el impacto de la transformación es multiplicar cada salida de la función madre por ; esto toma cualquier punto de la forma y lo transforma en , lo que significa que estamos reflejando cada punto en el gráfico de la función original a través del eje para generar el gráfico de la función resultante. Esto se demuestra en Figure donde es la reflexión de a través del eje .  Finalmente, también investigamos el caso donde , lo que genera . Aquí podemos pensar en como : el efecto de multiplicar por primero refleja el gráfico de a través del eje (resultando en ), y luego multiplicar por estira el gráfico de verticalmente para resultar en , como se muestra en Figure .    Al igual que con la traslación vertical y horizontal, es particularmente instructivo ver los efectos del escalado vertical de manera dinámica.   Demostración interactiva del escalado vertical (solo en la versión HTML).    Resumimos y generalizamos nuestras observaciones de Example y Figure de la siguiente manera.   Escalado Vertical de una Función  transformation of a function vertical scaling  Dada una función y un número real , la función transformada es un estiramiento vertical del gráfico de . Cada punto en el gráfico de se estira verticalmente al punto correspondiente en el gráfico de . Si , el gráfico de es una compresión de hacia el eje ; si , el gráfico de es un estiramiento de alejándose del eje . Los puntos donde no se ven afectados por la transformación.  Dada una función y un número real , la función transformada es una reflexión del gráfico de a través del eje seguida de un estiramiento vertical por un factor de .     Considera las funciones y dadas en Figure y Figure .    Una función madre .     Una función madre .        En los mismos ejes que el gráfico de , dibuja los siguientes gráficos: y . Asegúrate de etiquetar el punto en y que corresponde al punto en el gráfico original de . Además, escribe una oración para explicar las transformaciones generales que han resultado en y a partir de .    En los mismos ejes que el gráfico de , dibuja los siguientes gráficos: y . Asegúrate de etiquetar el punto en y que corresponde al punto en el gráfico original de . Además, escribe una oración para explicar las transformaciones generales que han resultado en y a partir de .    En las copias adicionales de las dos figuras a continuación, dibuja los gráficos de las siguientes funciones transformadas: (a la izquierda) y . Como antes, asegúrate de etiquetar un punto clave en cada gráfico que corresponda al punto etiquetado en la función madre original.        Describe con palabras cómo la función es el resultado de tres transformaciones elementales de . ¿Importa el orden en el que ocurren estas transformaciones? ¿Por qué o por qué no?                 Combinando desplazamientos y estiramientos: por qué el orden a veces importa  En la pregunta final de Activity , consideramos la transformación de la función original . Hay tres transformaciones básicas diferentes involucradas: un desplazamiento vertical de unidad hacia abajo, un desplazamiento horizontal de unidad hacia la izquierda y un estiramiento vertical por un factor de . Para entender el orden en que se aplican estas transformaciones, es esencial recordar que una función es un proceso que convierte entradas en salidas.  Por la regla algebraica para , . En palabras, esto significa que dado un valor de entrada para , hacemos los siguientes procesos en este orden particular:   sumar a y luego aplicar la función a la cantidad ;    multiplicar el resultado de por ;    restar del resultado de .   Estos tres pasos corresponden a tres transformaciones básicas: (1) desplazar la gráfica de a la izquierda por unidad; (2) estirar la gráfica resultante verticalmente por un factor de ; (3) desplazar la gráfica resultante verticalmente por unidades. Podemos ver el impacto gráfico de estos pasos algebraicos tomándolos uno a la vez. En Figure , vemos la función que resulta de un desplazamiento de unidad a la izquierda de la función principal en Figure . (Cada vez que tomamos un paso adicional, desatenderemos la función anterior haciéndola aparecer en un color más claro y con líneas discontinuas.)    La función madre .     La función madre junto con el desplazamiento horizontal .     Continuando, ahora consideramos la función , lo que resulta en un estiramiento vertical de alejándose del eje por un factor de , como se ve en Figure .    La función junto con las gráficas de y .     La función junto con las gráficas de , y .     Finalmente, llegamos a restando de ; esto, por supuesto, es un desplazamiento vertical de unidades, y produce la gráfica de mostrada en rojo en Figure . También podemos rastrear el punto en la función madre original: primero se mueve a la izquierda unidad a , luego se estira verticalmente por un factor de alejándose del eje a , y finalmente se desplaza unidad hacia abajo al punto , que vemos en la gráfica de .  Mientras que hay algunas transformaciones que se pueden ejecutar en cualquier orden (como una combinación de una traslación horizontal y una traslación vertical, como se ve en la parte (b) de Activity ), en otras situaciones el orden importa. Por ejemplo, en nuestra discusión anterior, tenemos que aplicar el estiramiento vertical antes de aplicar el desplazamiento vertical. Algebraicamente, esto es porque . La cantidad multiplica la función por primero (el estiramiento) y luego sigue el desplazamiento vertical; la cantidad desplaza la función hacia abajo unidad primero, y luego ejecuta un estiramiento vertical por un factor de . En el último escenario, el punto que se encuentra en se transforma primero a y luego a , lo cual no es lo mismo que el punto que se encuentra en .    Considera las funciones y dadas en Figure y Figure .    Una función madre .     Una función madre .        Dibuja una gráfica precisa de la transformación . Escribe al menos una oración para explicar cómo desarrollaste la gráfica de , e identifica el punto en que corresponde al punto original en la gráfica de .    Dibuja una gráfica precisa de la transformación . Escribe al menos una oración para explicar cómo desarrollaste la gráfica de , e identifica el punto en que corresponde al punto original en la gráfica de .    ¿Es la función la misma función que o diferente? ¿Por qué? Explica de dos maneras diferentes: discute las similitudes y diferencias algebraicas entre y , y también discute cómo cada una es una transformación de .    Encuentra una fórmula para una función (en términos de ) que represente esta transformación de : un desplazamiento horizontal de unidades a la izquierda, seguido de una reflexión a través del eje y un estiramiento vertical por un factor de unidades, seguido de un desplazamiento vertical de unidades. Dibuja una gráfica precisa y etiquetada de en los siguientes ejes junto con la función madre dada .                    Resumen     El gráfico de está relacionado con el gráfico de por una secuencia de transformaciones. Primero, hay un desplazamiento horizontal de unidades a la derecha ( ) o a la izquierda ( ). Luego, hay un estiramiento vertical por un factor de (junto con una reflexión a través de en el caso donde ). Finalmente, hay un desplazamiento vertical de unidades.    Una transformación de una función dada es un proceso por el cual el gráfico puede ser desplazado o estirado para generar una nueva función relacionada con la misma forma fundamental. En esta sección consideramos cuatro formas diferentes en que esto puede ocurrir: a través de una traslación horizontal (desplazamiento), a través de una reflexión a través de la línea (el eje ), a través de un escalado vertical (estiramiento) que multiplica cada salida de una función por la misma constante, y a través de una traslación vertical (desplazamiento). Cada uno de estos procesos individuales es en sí mismo una transformación, y pueden combinarse de varias maneras para crear transformaciones más complicadas.         The graph of is given below:   Find a formula for each of the transformations whose graphs are given below.  a)     b)                      To obtain a new graph, stretch the graph of a function vertically by a factor of 6. Then shift the new graph 4 units to the right and 2 units up. The result is the graph of a function where , , are certain numbers.

Enter points as including the parentheses.  (a) The graph of must contain the point  (b) The graph of must contain the point  (c) The graph of must contain the point                  SOLUTION (a) The translation moves the graph to the right 6 units. The -coordinate is not changed, but the -coordinate is , and the new point is therefore (15, 4). (b) The translation moves the graph down 5 units. The -coordinate is not changed, but the -coordinate is , and the new point is therefore (9, -1). (c) The translation moves the graph both to the left 2 units and up 7 units. Both coordinates will therefore change. The -coordinate is , the -coordinate is , and the new point is therefore (7, 11).        Let .     Let . Determine and for both and . What do you observe?

Find a formula for the transformation of that corresponds to a horizontal shift of units left, a reflection across and vertical stretch of units away from the -axis, and a vertical shift of units.

En aritmética, ejecutamos procesos donde tomamos dos números para generar un nuevo número. Por ejemplo, : el número resulta de sumar y . De manera similar, podemos multiplicar dos números para generar uno nuevo: .  Podemos trabajar de manera similar con funciones. De hecho, ya hemos visto una forma sofisticada de combinar dos funciones para generar una nueva función relacionada a través de la composición. Si y , entonces sabemos que hay una nueva función relacionada definida por el proceso . Dicho de otra manera, la nueva función resulta de ejecutar primero, seguido de .  Así como podemos sumar, restar, multiplicar y dividir números, también podemos sumar, restar, multiplicar y dividir funciones para crear una nueva función a partir de dos o más funciones dadas.    Considera las funciones y definidas por Table y las funciones lineales por partes y definidas por Figure . Supón que las líneas en la figura pasan por coordenadas de números enteros donde parece que lo hacen; por ejemplo, está en el gráfico de , y está en el gráfico de .    Tabla que define las funciones y .     0  1  2  3  4     5  10  15  20  25     9  5  3  2  3      Gráficos que definen las funciones y .        Sea . Determina .    Sea .

Determina exactamente.    ¿Hay algún valor de en el intervalo para el cual no esté definido? Si no, explica por qué; si es así, determina todos esos valores, con justificación.         Aritmética con funciones  En la mayoría de las matemáticas hasta el cálculo, el objeto principal que estudiamos son los números . Hacemos preguntas como    ¿qué número(s) forman soluciones a la ecuación ?      ¿qué número es la pendiente de la línea ?      ¿qué número se genera como salida por la función con la entrada ?    Ciertamente también estudiamos patrones generales como se ven en funciones y ecuaciones, pero esto usualmente ocurre a través de un examen de los números mismos, y pensamos en los números como los objetos principales sobre los que se actúa.  Esto cambia en el cálculo. En el cálculo, los objetos fundamentales que se estudian son las funciones mismas. Una función es un objeto matemático mucho más sofisticado que un número, en parte porque una función puede pensarse en términos de su gráfica, que es una colección infinita de pares ordenados de la forma .  A menudo es útil mirar la fórmula de una función y observar la estructura algebraica. Por ejemplo, dada la función cuadrática podríamos beneficiarnos de pensar en esto como la suma de tres funciones más simples: la función constante , la función lineal que pasa por con pendiente , y la función cuadrática básica cóncava hacia abajo . De hecho, cada una de las funciones más simples , , y contribuyen a hacer que sea la función que es. De igual manera, si estuviéramos interesados en la función , podría ser natural pensar en las dos funciones más simples y que se están multiplicando para producir .  Así llegamos naturalmente a las ideas de sumar, restar, multiplicar o dividir dos o más funciones, y por lo tanto introducimos las siguientes definiciones y notación.   function arithmetic sum of  function arithmetic difference of  function arithmetic product of  function arithmetic quotient of   Sean y funciones que comparten el mismo dominio.

Supón que las líneas y curvas dadas pasan por puntos de intersección en la cuadrícula cuando parece plausible. Por ejemplo, y están en el gráfico de , y y están en el gráfico de .    La función .     La función .        Determina el valor exacto de .    Determina el valor exacto de .    Determina el valor exacto de .    ¿Hay algún valor de para el cual no esté definido? Si no, explica por qué. Si es así, determina los valores y justifica tu respuesta.    ¿Para qué valores de es ? ¿Por qué?    ¿Hay algún valor de para el cual ? ¿Por qué o por qué no?                 Combinando funciones en contexto  Cuando trabajamos en entornos aplicados con funciones que modelan fenómenos en el mundo que nos rodea, a menudo es útil pensar cuidadosamente sobre las unidades de varias cantidades. Analizar las unidades puede ayudarnos tanto a entender la estructura algebraica de las funciones y las variables involucradas, como a asignar significado a las cantidades que calculamos. Ya hemos visto esto con la noción de tasa de cambio promedio: si una función mide la población en una ciudad en el año y calculamos , entonces las unidades en son personas por año, y el valor de nos está diciendo la tasa promedio a la que cambia la población en personas por año en el intervalo de tiempo desde el año hasta el año .    Supón que un inversor está comprando regularmente acciones en una empresa en particular. Este ejemplo está tomado de Section 2.3 de Active Calculus . Sea el número de acciones poseídas en el día , donde representa el primer día en que se compraron acciones. Sea el valor de una acción de la empresa en el día ; nota que las unidades en son dólares por acción. ¿Cómo se determina el valor total, , de las acciones poseídas en el día ?   Solución . Observa que las unidades en son acciones y las unidades en son dólares por acción . Así que cuando calculamos el producto , se sigue que las unidades resultantes son dólares , que es el valor total de las acciones poseídas. Por lo tanto, .      Sea una función que mide la economía de combustible de un coche de la siguiente manera. Dada una velocidad de entrada en millas por hora, es el número de galones de combustible que el coche consume por milla (es decir, galones por milla ). Sabemos que .     ¿Cuál es el significado de la afirmación en el contexto del problema? Es decir, ¿qué dice esto sobre la economía de combustible del coche? Escribe una oración completa para explicar.    Considera la función . ¿Cuál es el valor de ? ¿Cuáles son las unidades de ? ¿Qué mide ?    Considera la función . ¿Cuál es el valor de ? ¿Cuáles son las unidades de ? ¿Qué mide ?    ¿Nos dicen , y información fundamentalmente diferente, o esencialmente están diciendo lo mismo? Explica.    Supón que también sabemos que . Encuentra la tasa de cambio promedio de en el intervalo . ¿Cuáles son las unidades de la tasa de cambio promedio de ? ¿Qué mide esta cantidad? Escribe una oración completa para explicar.                 Funciones por tramos  En contextos tanto abstractos como aplicados, a veces tenemos que usar diferentes fórmulas en diferentes intervalos para definir una función de interés.    Una función familiar e importante que se define por tramos es la función valor absoluto: . Sabemos que si , , mientras que si , .    absolute value function   El valor absoluto de un número real, denotado por , se define por la regla        Un gráfico de la función valor absoluto, .     La función valor absoluto es un ejemplo de una función definida por tramos. La notación de corchete en Definición es cómo expresamos qué tramo de la función se aplica en qué intervalo. Como podemos ver en Figura , para valores de menores que , se aplica la función , mientras que para mayores o iguales a , la regla está determinada por .  Mientras tengamos cuidado de asegurarnos de que cada entrada potencial tenga una y solo una salida correspondiente, podemos definir una función por tramos usando tantas funciones diferentes en diferentes intervalos como deseemos.    En lo que sigue, trabajamos para entender dos funciones por tramos diferentes completamente a mano basándonos en propiedades familiares de funciones lineales y cuadráticas.     Considera la función definida por la siguiente regla: ¿Cuáles son los valores de , , , , y ?    ¿Qué punto es el vértice de la parte cuadrática de que es válida para ? ¿Qué punto es el vértice de la parte cuadrática de que es válida para ?    ¿Para qué valores de es ? Además, ¿cuál es la intersección con el eje de ?    Dibuja un gráfico preciso y etiquetado de en los ejes proporcionados en Figura .    Ejes para graficar .     Gráfico de .       Para la función definida por Figura , determina una fórmula definida por tramos para que esté expresada en notación de corchetes similar a la definición de anterior.                 Resumen     Así como podemos generar un nuevo número sumando, restando, multiplicando o dividiendo dos números dados, podemos generar una nueva función sumando, restando, multiplicando o dividiendo dos funciones dadas. Por ejemplo, si conocemos fórmulas, gráficos o tablas para las funciones y que comparten el mismo dominio, podemos crear su producto según la regla .    Una función por tramos es una función cuya fórmula consiste en al menos dos fórmulas diferentes de tal manera que cuál fórmula se aplica depende de dónde cae la entrada en el dominio. Por ejemplo, dadas dos funciones y cada una definida en todos los números reales, podemos definir una nueva función por tramos según la regla Esto nos dice que para cualquier a la izquierda de , usamos la regla para , mientras que para cualquier a la derecha de o igual a , usamos la regla para . Podemos usar tantas funciones diferentes como queramos en diferentes intervalos, siempre que los intervalos no se superpongan.

Exercise Answer   Exercise Solution    One of the most important principles in the study of changing quantities is found in the relationship between distance, average velocity, and time. For a moving body traveling on a straight-line path at an average rate of for a period of time , the distance traveled, , is given by   In the Ironman Triathlon, competitors swim miles, bike miles, and then run a mile marathon. In the following sequence of questions, we build a piecewise function that models a competitor's location in the race at a given time . To start, we have the following known information.   She swims at an average rate of miles per hour throughout the miles in the water.    Her transition from swim to bike takes minutes ( hours), during which time she doesn't travel any additional distance.    She bikes at an average rate of miles per hour throughout the miles of biking.    Her transition from bike to run takes just over minutes ( hours), during which time she doesn't travel any additional distance.    She runs at an average rate of miles per hour throughout the marathon.    In the questions that follow, assume for the purposes of the model that the triathlete swims, bikes, and runs at essentially constant rates (given by the average rates stated above).      Determine the time the swimmer exits the water. Report your result in hours.    Likewise, determine the time the athlete gets off her bike, as well as the time she finishes the race.    List 5 key points in the form (time, distance): when exiting the water, when starting the bike, when finishing the bike, when starting the run, and when finishing the run.    What is the triathlete's average velocity over the course of the entire race? Is this velocity the average of her swim velocity, bike velocity, and run velocity? Why or why not?    Determine a piecewise function whose value at any given time (in hours) is the triathlete's total distance traveled.    Sketch a carefully labeled graph of the triathlete's distance traveled as a function of time on the axes provided. Provide clear scale and note key points on the graph.        Sketch a possible graph of the triathete's velocity , , as a function of time on the righthand axes. Here, too, label key points and provide clear scale. Write several sentences to explain and justify your graph.         "

What are some important properties that characterize a function generated by a point traversing a circle?    How does a circular function change in ways that are different from linear and quadratic functions?      Certain naturally occurring phenomena eventually repeat themselves, especially when the phenomenon is somehow connected to a circle. For example, suppose that you are taking a ride on a ferris wheel and we consider your height, , above the ground and how your height changes in tandem with the distance, , that you have traveled around the wheel.

Because we have two quantities changing in tandem, it is natural to wonder if it is possible to represent one as a function of the other.    In the context of the ferris wheel pictured in Figure , assume that the height, , of the moving point (the cab in which you are riding), and the distance, , that the point has traveled around the circumference of the ferris wheel are both measured in meters.  Further, assume that the circumference of the ferris wheel is meters. In addition, suppose that after getting in your cab at the lowest point on the wheel, you traverse the full circle several times.     Recall that the circumference, , of a circle is connected to the circle's radius, , by the formula . What is the radius of the ferris wheel? How high is the highest point on the ferris wheel?    How high is the cab after it has traveled of the circumference of the circle?    How much distance along the circle has the cab traversed at the moment it first reaches a height of meters?

Write several sentences to explain.         Circular Functions  circular functions  The natural phenomenon of a point moving around a circle leads to interesting relationships. For easier arithmetic, let's consider a point traversing a circle of circumference and examine how the point's height, , changes as the distance traversed, , changes. Note particularly that each time the point traverses of the circumference of the circle, it travels a distance of units, as seen in Figure where each noted point lies additional units along the circle beyond the preceding one.   A point traversing a circle with circumference .    Note that we know the exact heights of certain points. Since the circle has circumference , we know that and therefore . Hence, the point where (located of the way along the circle) is at a height of . Doubling this value, the point where has height . Other heights, such as those that correspond to and (identified on the figure by the green line segments) are not obvious from the circle's radius, but can be estimated from the grid in Figure as (for ) and (for ). Using all of these observations along with the symmetry of the circle, we can determine the other entries in Table .   Data for height, , as a function of distance traversed, .                             Moreover, if we now let the point continue traversing the circle, we observe that the -values will increase accordingly, but the -values will repeat according to the already-established pattern, resulting in the data in Table .   Additional data for height, , as a function of distance traversed, .                             It is apparent that each point on the circle corresponds to one and only one height, and thus we can view the height of a point as a function of the distance the point has traversed around the circle, say . Using the data from the two tables and connecting the points in an intuitive way, we get the graph shown in Figure .   The height, , of a point traversing a circle of circumference as a function of distance, , traversed around the circle.    The function we have been discussing is an example of what we will call a circular function . circular function Indeed, it is apparent that if we   take any circle in the plane,    choose a starting location for a point on the circle,    let the point traverse the circle continuously,    and track the height of the point as it traverses the circle,   the height of the point is a function of distance traversed and the resulting graph will have the same basic shape as the curve shown in Figure . It also turns out that if we track the location of the -coordinate of the point on the circle, the -coordinate is also a function of distance traversed and its curve has a similar shape to the graph of the height of the point (the -coordinate). Both of these functions are circular functions because they are generated by motion around a circle.    Consider the circle pictured in Figure that is centered at the point and that has circumference . Assume that we track the -coordinate (that is, the height, ) of a point that is traversing the circle counterclockwise and that it starts at as pictured.    A point traversing the circle.     Axes for plotting as a function of .        How far along the circle is the point from ? Why?    Label the subsequent points in the figure , , as we move counterclockwise around the circle. What is the exact -coordinate of the point ? of ? Why?    Determine the -coordinates of the remaining points on the circle (exactly where possible, otherwise approximately) and hence complete the entries in Table that track the height, , of the point traversing the circle as a function of distance traveled, . Note that the -values in the table correspond to the point traversing the circle more than once.   Data for as a function of .                                               By plotting the points in Table and connecting them in an intuitive way, sketch a graph of as a function of on the axes provided in Figure over the interval . Clearly label the scale of your axes and the coordinates of several important points on the curve.    What is similar about your graph in comparison to the one in Figure ? What is different?    What will be the value of when ? How about when ?                 Properties of Circular Functions  Every circular function has several important features that are connected to the circle that defines the function. For the discussion that follows, we focus on circular functions that result from tracking the -coordinate of a point traversing counterclockwise a circle of radius centered at the point . Further, we will denote the circumference of the circle by the letter .    A point traversing the circle.     Plotting as a function of .     We assume that the point traversing the circle starts at in Figure . Its height is initially , and then its height decreases to as we traverse to . Continuing, the point's height falls to at , and then rises back to at , and eventually back up to at the top of the circle. If we plot these heights continuously as a function of distance, , traversed around the circle, we get the curve shown at right in Figure . This curve has several important features for which we introduce important terminology.  The midline  circular function midline of a circular function is the horizontal line for which half the curve lies above the line and half the curve lies below. If the circular function results from tracking the -coordinate of a point traversing a circle, corresponds to the -coordinate of the center of the circle. In addition, the amplitude  circular function amplitude of a circular function is the maximum deviation of the curve from the midline. Note particularly that the value of the amplitude, , corresponds to the radius of the circle that generates the curve.  Because we can traverse the circle in either direction and for as far as we wish, the domain of any circular function is the set of all real numbers. From our observations about the midline and amplitude, it follows that the range of a circular function circular function range with midline and amplitude is the interval .  Finally, we introduce the formal definition of a periodic function.   function periodic  period   Let be a function whose domain and codomain are each the set of all real numbers. We say that is periodic provided that there exists a real number such that for every possible choice of . The smallest positive value for which for every choice of is called the period of .    For a circular function, the period is always the circumference of the circle that generates the curve. In Figure , we see how the curve has completed one full cycle of behavior every units, regardless of where we start on the curve.  Circular functions arise as models for important phenomena in the world around us, such as in a harmonic oscillator . harmonic oscillator Consider a mass attached to a spring where the mass sits on a frictionless surface. After setting the mass in motion by stretching or compressing the spring, the mass will oscillate indefinitely back and forth, and its distance from a fixed point on the surface turns out to be given by a circular function.    A weight is placed on a frictionless table next to a wall and attached to a spring that is fixed to the wall. From its natural position of rest, the weight is imparted an initial velocity that sets it in motion. The weight then oscillates back and forth, and we can measure its distance, (in inches) from the wall at any given time, (in seconds). A graph of and a table of select values are given below.                                                                                    Determine the period , midline , and amplitude of the function .    What is the greatest distance the weight is displaced from the wall? What is the least distance the weight is displaced from the wall? What is the range of ?    Determine the average rate of change of on the intervals and . Write one careful sentence to explain the meaning of each (including units). In addition, write a sentence to compare the two different values you find and what they together say about the motion of the weight.    Based on the periodicity of the function, what is the value of ? of ?                 The average rate of change of a circular function  Just as there are important trends in the values of a circular function, there are also interesting patterns in the average rate of change of the function. These patterns are closely tied to the geometry of the circle.  For the next part of our discussion, we consider a circle of radius centered at , and consider a point that travels a distance counterclockwise around the circle with its starting point viewed as . We use this circle to generate the circular function that tracks the height of the point at the moment the point has traversed units around the circle from . Let's consider the average rate of change of on several intervals that are connected to certain fractions of the circumference.  Remembering that is a function of distance traversed along the circle, it follows that the average rate of change of on any interval of distance between two points and on the circle is given by , where both quantities are measured from point to point .  First, in Figure , we consider points , , and where results from traversing of the circumference from , and  of the circumference from . In particular, we note that the distance along the circle from to is the same as the distance along the circle from to , and thus . At the same time, it is apparent from the geometry of the circle that the change in height from to is greater than the change in height from to , so . Thus, we can say that .    Comparing the average rate of change over the circumference.     Comparing the average rate of change over the circumference.     The differences in certain average rates of change appear to become more extreme if we consider shorter arcs along the circle. Next we consider traveling of the circumference along the circle. In Figure , points and lie of the circumference apart, as do and , so here . In this situation, it is the case that for the same reasons as above, but we can say even more. From the green triangle in Figure , we see that (while ), so that . At the same time, in the magenta triangle in the figure we see that is very small, especially in comparison to , and thus . Hence, in Figure , . This information tells us that a circular function appears to change most rapidly for points near its midline and to change least rapidly for points near its highest and lowest values.  We can study the average rate of change not only on the circle itself, but also on a graph such as Figure , and thus make conclusions about where the function is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down.    Consider the same setting as Activity : a weight oscillates back and forth on a frictionless table with distance from the wall given by, (in inches) at any given time, (in seconds). A graph of and a table of select values are given below.                                                                                    Determine , , , and . What do these four values tell us about how the weight is moving on the interval ?    Give an example of an interval of length units on which has its most negative average rate of change. Justify your choice.    Give an example of the longest interval you can find on which is decreasing.    Give an example of an interval on which is concave up. Recall that a function is concave up on an interval provided that throughout the interval, the curve bends upward, similar to a parabola that opens up.     On an interval where is both decreasing and concave down, what does this tell us about how the weight is moving on that interval? For instance, is the weight moving toward or away from the wall? is it speeding up or slowing down?    What general conclusions can you make about the average rate of change of a circular function on intervals near its highest or lowest points? about its average rate of change on intervals near the function's midline?                 Summary     When a point traverses a circle, a corresponding function can be generated by tracking the height of the point as it moves around the circle, where height is viewed as a function of distance traveled around the circle. We call such a function a circular function . An image that shows how a circular function's graph is generated from the circle can be seen in Figure .    Circular functions have several standard features. The function has a midline that is the line for which half the points on the curve lie above the line and half the points on the curve lie below. A circular function's amplitude is the maximum deviation of the function value from the midline; the amplitude corresponds to the radius of the circle that generates the function. Circular functions also repeat themselves, and we call the smallest value of for which for all the period of the function. The period of a circular function corresponds to the circumference of the circle that generates the function.    Non-constant linear functions are either always increasing or always decreasing; quadratic functions are either always concave up or always concave down. Circular functions are sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing, plus sometimes concave up and sometimes concave down. These behaviors are closely tied to the geometry of the circle.         Let be a periodic function whose values are given below. Find the period, amplitude, and midline.    x  5  25  45  65  85  105  125  145  165    f(x)  17  15  -3  17  15  -3  17  15  -3    (a) The period of the graph is  (b) The midline of the graph is  (c) The amplitude of the graph is                  SOLUTION (a) The graph appears to have a period of 60. Every change in the value of 60 brings us back to the same value. (b) The midline of the graph is 7 since (c) The amplitude is how much the maximum or minimum value differs from the average (midline). Since the maximum value is 17 and the midline is 7, the amplitude is .        A ferris wheel is 140 meters in diameter and boarded at its lowest point (6 O'Clock) from a platform which is 8 meters above ground. The wheel makes one full rotation every 14 minutes, and at time you are at the loading platform (6 O'Clock). Let denote your height above ground in meters after minutes.  (a) What is the period of the function ?  period = Include units in your answer.  (b) What is the midline of the function ?   Include units in your answer.  (c) What is the amplitude of the function ?  amplitude = Include units in your answer.  (d) Consider the six possible graphs of below. Be sure to enlarge each graph and carefully read the labels on the axes in order distinguish the key features of each graph.  Which (if any) of the graphs A-F represents two full revolutions of the ferris wheel described above?   Select    A    B    C    D    E    F    None of the graphs above           A  B  C         D  E  F                         SOLUTION (a) Since the ferris wheel makes one full rotation every 14 minutes, the period is 14 minutes. (b) The midline is the height when you are halfway up the ferris wheel. If the ferris wheel has a diameter of 140 meters and the loading platform is 8 meters above the ground, the height midway up the ferris wheel is . So the midline is meters. (c) The amplitude is the difference of your height on top of the ferris wheel and your height at the midline (or halfway up the ferris wheel). When you are highest on the ferris wheel, your height is . Therefore the amplitude is meters. (d) Based on the answers above, the correct answer is graph B.        A weight is suspended from the ceiling by a spring. Let be the distance in centimeters from the ceiling to the weight. When the weight is motionless, .

(a) Based on the graph of above, which of the statements below correctly describes the motion of the weight as it bobs up and down?    The weight starts closest to the floor and begins by bouncing up towards the ceiling.    The weight starts closest to the ceiling and begins by stretching the spring down towards the floor.    The spring starts at its average distance between the ceiling and floor and begins by stretching the spring down towards the floor.    None of the above    (b) How long does it take the weight to bounce completely up and down (or down and up) and return to its starting position?  (Include units in your answer.)  (c) What is the closest the weight gets to the ceiling?  (Include units in your answer.)  (d) What is the furthest the weights gets from the ceiling?  (Include units in your answer.)  (e) What is the amplitdue of the graph of ?  (Include units in your answer.)    B                  SOLUTION (a) The weight's initial distance from the ceiling is at its smallest value 3 cm. Thus the weight starts at its closest position from the ceiling. It then begins to head down away from the ceiling towards the floor.

  "body": " The Unit Circle     What is the radian measure of an angle?    Are there natural special points on the unit circle whose coordinates we can identify exactly?    How can we determine arc length and the location of special points in circles other than the unit circle?      As demonstrated by several different examples in Section , certain periodic phenomena are closely linked to circles and circular motion. Rather than regularly work with circles of different center and radius, it turns out to be ideal to work with one standard circle and build all circular functions from it. The unit circle  unit circle is the circle of radius that is centered at the origin, .  If we pick any point that lies on the unit circle, the point is associated with a right triangle whose horizontal leg has length and whose vertical leg has length , as seen in Figure . By the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that , and this is the equation of the unit circle: a point lies on the unit circle if and only if .    Coordinates of a point on the unit circle.     A point traversing the unit circle.     To study the circular functions generated by the unit circle, we will also animate a point and let it traverse the circle. Starting at indicated by in Figure , we see a sequence of points that result from traveling a distance along the circle that is the circumference of the unit circle. Since the unit circle's circumference is , it follows that the distance from to is . As we work to better understand the unit circle, we will commonly use fractional multiples of as these result in natural distances traveled along the unit circle.    In Figure there are 24 equally spaced points on the unit circle. Since the circumference of the unit circle is , each of the points is units apart (traveled along the circle). Thus, the first point counterclockwise from corresponds to the distance traveled along the unit circle. The second point is twice as far, and thus units along the circle away from .   The unit circle with equally-spaced points.       Label each of the subsequent points on the unit circle with the exact distance they lie counter-clockwise away from ; write each fraction in lowest terms.    Which distance along the unit circle corresponds to of a full rotation around? to of a full rotation?     One way to measure angles is connected to the arc length along a circle. For an angle whose vertex is at in the unit circle, we say the angle's measure is radian  radian provided that the angle intercepts an arc of the circle that is unit in length, as pictured in Figure . Note particularly that an angle measuring radian intercepts an arc of the same length as the circle's radius.   An angle of measure radian.     Suppose that and are angles with respective radian measures and . Assuming that we view and as having their vertex at and one side along the positive -axis, sketch the angles and on the unit circle in Figure .    What is the radian measure that corresponds to a angle?         Radians and degrees  In Preview Activity , we introduced the idea of radian measure of an angle. Here we state the formal definition of this term.   radian measure definition of   An angle whose vertex is at the center of a circle We often call such an angle a central angle . measures radian provided that the arc the angle intercepts on the circle equals the radius of the circle.    As seen in Figure , in the unit circle this means that a central angle has measure radian whenever it intercepts an arc of length unit along the circumference. Because of this important correspondence between the unit circle and radian measure (one unit of arc length on the unit circle corresponds to radian), we focus our discussion of radian measure within the unit circle.  Since there are units of length along the unit circle's circumference it follows there are units of length in of a revolution. We also know that of a revolution corresponds to a central angle that is a right angle, whose familiar degree measure is . If we extend to a central angle that intercepts half the circle, we see similarly that radians corresponds to ; this relationship enables us to convert angle measures from radians to degrees and vice versa.   Converting between radians and degrees  An angle whose radian measure is radian has degree measure . An angle whose degree measure is has radian measure .     Convert each of the following quantities to the alternative measure: degrees to radians or radians to degrees.           radians     radians               radians               Note that in Figure in the Preview Activity, we labeled equally spaced points with their respective distances around the unit circle counterclockwise from . Because these distances are on the unit circle, they also correspond to the radian measure of the central angles that intercept them. In particular, each central angle with one of its sides on the positive -axis generates a unique point on the unit circle, and with it, an associated length intercepted along the circumference of the circle. A good exercise at this point is to return to Figure and label each of the noted points with the degree measure that is intercepted by a central angle with one side on the positive -axis, in addition to the arc lengths (radian measures) already identified.    Special points on the unit circle  Our in-depth study of the unit circle is motivated by our desire to better understand the behavior of circular functions. Recall that as we traverse a circle, the height of the point moving along the circle generates a function that depends on distance traveled along the circle. Wherever possible, we'd like to be able to identify the exact height of a given point on the unit circle. Two special right triangles enable us to locate exactly an important collection of points on the unit circle.    In what follows, we work to understand key relationships in - - and - - triangles.    A right triangle with two angles.     A right triangle with a angle.        For the - - triangle with legs of length and and hypotenuse of length , what does the fact that the triangle is isosceles tell us about the relationship between and ? What are their exact values?    Now consider the - - triangle with hypotenuse of length and the longer leg (of length ) lying along the positive -axis. What special kind of triangle is formed when we reflect this triangle across the -axis? How can we use this perspective to determine the exact values of and ?    Suppose we consider the related - - triangle with hypotenuse of length and the shorter leg (of length ) lying along the positive -axis. What are the exact values of and in this triangle?    We know from the conversion factor from degrees to radians that an angle of corresponds to an angle measuring radians, an angle of corresponds to radians, and corresponds to radians.    An angle measuring radians.     An angle measuring radians.     An angle measuring radians.     Use your work in (a), (b), and (c) to label the noted point in each of Figure , Figure , and Figure , respectively, with its exact coordinates.               Our work in Activity enables us to identify exactly the location of special points on the unit circle. In part (d) of the activity, we located the three noted points in Figure along with their respective radian measures. By symmetry across the coordinate axes and thinking about the signs of coordinates in the other three quadrants, we can now identify all of the coordinates of the remaining points.   The unit circle with special points whose location we can determine exactly.    In addition, we note that there are four additional points on the circle that we can locate exactly: the four points that correspond to angle measures of , , , and radians, which lie where the coordinate axes intersect the circle. Each such point has for one coordinate and for the other. Labeling all of the remaining points in Figure is an important exercise that you should do on your own.  Finally, we note that we can identify any point on the unit circle exactly simply by choosing one of its coordinates. Since every point on the unit circle satisfies the equation , if we know the value of or and the quadrant in which the point lies, we can determine the other coordinate exactly.    Special points and arc length in non-unit circles  All of our work with the unit circle can be extended to circles centered at the origin with different radii, since a circle with a larger or smaller radius is a scaled version of the unit circle. For instance, if we instead consider a circle of radius , the coordinates of every point on the unit circle are magnified by a factor of , so the point that corresponds to an angle such as has coordinates . Distance along the circle is magnified by the same factor: the arc length along the unit circle from to is , since the arc length along the unit circle for this angle is .  If we think more generally about a circle of radius with a central angle that intercepts an arc of length , we see how the magnification factor (in comparison to the unit circle) connects arc length and the central angle according to the following principle.   Connecting arc length and angles in non-unit circles  If a central angle measuring radians intercepts an arc of length in a circle of radius , then .  In the unit circle, where , the equation demonstrates the familiar fact that arc length matches the radian measure of the central angle. Moreover, we also see how this formula aligns with the definition of radian measure: if the arc length and radius are equal, then the angle measures radian.     Determine each of the following values or points exactly.     In a circle of radius , the arc length intercepted by a central angle of .    In a circle of radius , the central angle measure that intercepts an arc of length .    The radius of the circle in which an angle of intercepts an arc of length .    The exact coordinates of the point on the circle of radius that lies units counterclockwise along the circle from .                 Summary     The radian measure of an angle connects the measure of a central angle in a circle to the radius of the circle. A central angle has radian measure provided that it intercepts an arc of length equal to the circle's radius. In the unit circle, a central angle's radian measure is precisely the same numerical value as the length of the arc it intercepts along the circle.    If we begin at the point and move counterclockwise along the unit circle, there are natural special points on the unit circle that correspond to angles of measure , , , and their multiples. We can count in increments and identify special points that correspond to angles of measure , , , , and so on; doing likewise with , these correspond to angles of , , , etc. In radian measure, these sequences together give us the important angles , , , , , , and so on. Together with our work involving - - and - - triangles in Activity , we are able to identify the exact locations of all of the points in Figure .    In any circle of radius , if a central angle of measure radians intercepts an arc of length , then it follows that . This shows that arc length, , is magnified along with the size of the radius, , of the circle.

The definition of the sine of an angle .     Because of the correspondence between radian angle measure and distance traversed on the unit circle, we can also think of as identifying the -coordinate of the point after it has traveled units counterclockwise along the circle from . Note particularly that we can consider the sine of negative inputs: for instance, .  Based on our earlier work with the unit circle, we know many different exact values of the sine function, and summarize these in Table .   Values of at special points on the unit circle.                                                        Moreover, if we now plot these points in the usual way, as we did in Preview Activity , we get the familiar circular wave function that comes from tracking the height of a point traversing a circle. We often call the graph in Figure the sine wave .   Plot of the sine function on the interval .      The definition of the cosine function  Given any central angle of radian measure in the unit circle with one side passing through the point , the angle generates a unique point that lies on the circle. Just as we can view the -coordinate as a function of , the -coordinate is likewise a function of . We therefore make the following definition.     cosine function   Given a central angle in the unit circle that measures radians and that intersects the circle at both and , as shown in Figure , we define the cosine of , denoted , by the rule .      The definition of the cosine of an angle .     Again because of the correspondence between the radian measure of an angle and arc length along the unit circle, we can view the value of as tracking the -coordinate of a point traversing the unit circle clockwise a distance of units along the circle from . We now use the data and information we have developed about the unit circle to build a table of values of as well as a graph of the curve it generates.    Let be the function that tracks the -coordinate of a point traversing the unit circle counterclockwise from . That is, . Use the information we know about the unit circle that is summarized in Figure to respond to the following questions.     What is the exact value of ? of ? ?    Complete the following table with the exact values of that correspond to the stated inputs.   Exact values of .                                                          On the axes provided in Figure , sketch an accurate graph of . Label the exact location of several key points on the curve.   Axes for plotting .      What is the exact value of ? of ?    Give four different values of for which .    How is the graph of different from the graph of ? How are the graphs similar?               As we work with the sine and cosine functions, it's always helpful to remember their definitions in terms of the unit circle and the motion of a point traversing the circle. At http:\/\/gvsu.edu\/s\/0xe you can explore and investigate a helpful Desmos animation that shows how this motion around the circle generates each of the respective graphs.    Properties of the sine and cosine functions  Because the sine function results from tracking the -coordinate of a point traversing the unit circle and the cosine function from the -coordinate, the two functions have several shared properties of circular functions.   Properties of the sine and cosine functions  For both and ,     the domain of the function is all real numbers;    the range of the function is ;    the midline of the function is ;    the amplitude of the function is ;    the period of the function is .      It is also insightful to juxtapose the sine and cosine functions' graphs on the same coordinate axes. When we do, as seen in Figure , we see that the curves can be viewed as horizontal translations of one another.   Graphs of the sine and cosine functions.    In particular, since the sine graph can be viewed as the cosine graph shifted units to the right, it follows that for any value of , . Similarly, since the cosine graph can be viewed as the sine graph shifted left, . Because each of the two preceding equations hold for every value of , they are often referred to as identities .  In light of the definitions of the sine and cosine functions, we can now view any point on the unit circle as being of the form , where is the measure of the angle whose vertices are , , and . Note particularly that since , it is also true that . We call this fact the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity.   The Fundamental Trigonometric Identity  For any real number , .   There are additional trends and patterns in the two functions' graphs that we explore further in the following activity.    Use Figure to assist in answering the following questions.     Give an example of the largest interval you can find on which is decreasing.    Give an example of the largest interval you can find on which is decreasing and concave down.    Give an example of the largest interval you can find on which is increasing.    Give an example of the largest interval you can find on which is increasing and concave up.    Without doing any computation, on which interval is the average rate of change of greater: or ? Why?    In general, how would you characterize the locations on the sine and cosine graphs where the functions are increasing or decreasingly most rapidly?    Thinking from the perspective of the unit circle, for which quadrants of the - plane is negative for an angle that lies in that quadrant?                 Using computing technology  We have established that we know the exact value of and for any of the -values in Table , as well as for any such , where is a whole number, due to the periodicity of the functions. But what if we want to know or or values for other inputs not in the table?  Any standard computing device such as a scientific calculator, Desmos , Geogebra , or WolframAlpha , has the ability to evaluate the sine and cosine functions at any input we desire. Because the input is viewed as an angle, each computing device has the option to consider the angle in radians or degrees. It is always essential that you are sure which type of input your device is expecting. Our computational device of choice is Desmos . In Desmos , you can change the input type between radians and degrees by clicking the wrench icon in the upper right and choosing the desired units. Radian measure is the default.  It takes substantial and sophisticated mathematics to enable a computational device to evaluate the sine and cosine functions at any value we want; the algorithms involve an idea from calculus known as an infinite series. While your computational device is powerful, it's both helpful and important to understand the meaning of these values on the unit circle and to remember the special points for which we know the outputs of the sine and cosine functions exactly.    Answer the following questions exactly wherever possible. If you estimate a value, do so to at least decimal places of accuracy.     The coordinate of the point on the unit circle that lies in the third quadrant and whose -coordinate is .    The -coordinate of the point on the unit circle generated by a central angle opening counterclockwise with one side on the positive -axis that measures radians.    The -coordinate of the point on the unit circle generated by a central angle with one side on the positive -axis that measures radians. (With the negative radian measure, we view the angle as opening counterclockwise from its initial side on the positive -axis.)    The value of where is an angle in Quadrant II that satisfies .    The value of where is an angle in Quadrant III for which .    The average rate of change of on the intervals and .    The average rate of change of on the intervals and .                 Summary     The sine and cosine functions result from tracking the - and -coordinates of a point traversing the unit circle counterclockwise from . The value of is the -coordinate of a point that has traversed units along the circle from (or equivalently that corresponds to an angle of radians), while the value of is the -coordinate of the same point.    The sine and cosine functions are both periodic functions that share the same domain (the set of all real numbers), range (the interval ), midline ( ), amplitude ( ), and period ( ). In addition, the sine function is horizontal shift of the cosine function by units to the right, so for any value of .    If corresponds to one of the special angles that we know on the unit circle (as in Figure ), we can compute the values of and exactly. For other values of , we can use a computational device to estimate the value of either function at a given input; when we do so, we must take care to know whether we are computing in terms of radians or degrees.

  "body": " Sinusoidal Functions     How do the three standard transformations (vertical translation, horizontal translation, and vertical scaling) affect the midline, amplitude, range, and period of sine and cosine curves?    What algebraic transformation results in horizontal stretching or scaling of a function?    How can we determine a formula involving sine or cosine that models any circular periodic function for which the midline, amplitude, period, and an anchor point are known?      Recall our work in Section , where we studied how the graph of the function defined by is related to the graph of , where , , and are real numbers with . Because such transformations can shift and stretch a function, we are interested in understanding how we can use transformations of the sine and cosine functions to fit formulas to circular functions.    Let . First, answer all of the questions below without using Desmos ; then use Desmos to confirm your conjectures. For each prompt, describe the graphs of and as transformations of and, in addition, state the amplitude, midline, and period of both and .      and      and      and      and          Shifts and vertical stretches of the sine and cosine functions  We know that the standard functions and are circular functions that each have midline , amplitude , period , and range . Our work in Preview Activity suggests the following general principles.   Transformations of sine and cosine  Given real numbers , , and with , the functions each represent a horizontal shift by units to the right, followed by a vertical stretch by units (if , there is also a reflection across the -axis), followed by a vertical shift of units, applied to the parent function ( or , respectively). The resulting circular functions have midline , amplitude , range , and period . In addition, the point lies on the graph of and the point lies on the graph of .   In Figure , we see how the overall transformation comes from executing a sequence of simpler ones. The original parent function (in dark gray) is first shifted units right to generate the light red graph of . In turn, that graph is then scaled vertically by to generate the purple graph of . Finally, the purple graph is shifted units vertically to result in the final graph of in blue.   A sequence of transformations of .    It is often useful to follow one particular point through a sequence of transformations. In Figure , we see the red point that is located at on the original function , as well as the point that is the corresponding point on under the overall transformation. Note that the point results from the input, , that makes the argument of the cosine function zero: .  While the sine and cosine functions extend infinitely in either direction, it's natural to think of the point as the starting point of the cosine function, and similarly the point as the starting point of the sine function. We will refer to the corresponding point on , and on , respectively, as the anchor point . sinusoidal function anchor point The anchor point, along with other information about a circular function's amplitude, midline, and period help us to determine a formula for a function that fits a given situation.  For example, in Figure , the anchor point on corresponds to the starting point  on .    Consider a spring-mass system where a weight is resting on a frictionless table. We let denote the distance from the wall (where the spring is attached) to the weight at time in seconds and know that the weight oscillates periodically with a minimum value of feet and a maximum value of feet with a period of . We also know that and .  Determine a formula for in the form or . Is it possible to find two different formulas that work? For any formula you find, identify the anchor point.              Horizontal scaling  There is one more very important transformation of a function that we've not yet explored. Given a function , we want to understand the related function , where is a positive real number. The sine and cosine functions are ideal functions with which to explore these effects; moreover, this transformation is crucial for being able to use the sine and cosine functions to model phenomena that oscillate at different frequencies.  In the interactive Figure , we can explore the effect of the transformation , where .   Interactive horizontal scaling demonstration (in the HTML version only).    By experimenting with the slider, we gain an intuitive sense for how the value of affects the graph of in comparision to the graph of . When , we see that the graph of is oscillating twice as fast as the graph of since completes two full cycles over an interval in which completes one full cycle. In contrast, when , the graph of oscillates half as fast as the graph of , as completes only half of one cycle over an interval where completes a full one.  We can also understand this from the perspective of function composition. To evaluate , at a given value of , we first multiply the input by a factor of , and then evaluate the function at the result. An important observation is that . This tells us that the point lies on the graph of since an input of in results in the value . At the same time, the point lies on the graph of . Thus we see that the correlation between points on the graphs of and (where ) is . We can therefore think of the transformation as achieving the output values of twice as fast as the original function does. Analogously, the transformation will achieve the output values of only half as quickly as the original function.   Horizontal scaling  horizontal scaling  Given a function and a real number , the transformed function is a horizontal stretch of the graph of . Every point on the graph of gets stretched horizontally to the corresponding point on the graph of . If , the graph of is a stretch of away from the -axis by a factor of ; if , the graph of is a compression of toward the -axis by a factor of . The only point on the graph of that is unchanged by the transformation is .   While we will soon focus on horizontal stretches of the sine and cosine functions for the remainder of this section, it's important to note that horizontal scaling follows the same principles for any function we choose.    Consider the functions and given in Figure and Figure .    A parent function .     A parent function .        On the same axes as the plot of , sketch the following graphs: and . Be sure to label several points on each of , , and with arrows to indicate their correspondence.

Be sure to label several points on each of , , and with arrows to indicate their correspondence. In addition, write one sentence to explain the overall transformations that have resulted in and from .    On the additional copies of the two figures below, sketch the graphs of the following transformed functions: (at left) and . As above, be sure to label several points on each graph and indicate their correspondence to points on the original parent function.        Describe in words how the function is the result of composing two elementary transformations of . Does the order in which these transformations are composed matter? Why or why not?                 Circular functions with different periods  Because the circumference of the unit circle is , the sine and cosine functions each have period . Of course, as we think about using transformations of the sine and cosine functions to model different phenomena, it is apparent that we will need to generate functions with different periods than . For instance, if a ferris wheel makes one revolution every minutes, we'd want the period of the function that models the height of one car as a function of time to be . Horizontal scaling of functions enables us to generate circular functions with any period we desire.  We begin by considering two basic examples. First, let and . We know from our most recent work that this transformation results in a horizontal compression of the graph of by a factor of toward the -axis. If we plot the two functions on the same axes as seen in Figure , it becomes apparent how this transformation affects the period of .   A plot of the parent function, (dashed, in gray), and the transformed function (in blue).    From the graph, we see that oscillates twice as frequently as , and that completes a full cycle on the interval , which is half the length of the period of . Thus, the in causes the period of to be as long; specifially, the period of is .   A plot of the parent function, (dashed, in gray), and the transformed function (in blue).    On the other hand, if we let , the transformed graph is stretched away from the -axis by a factor of . This has the effect of doubling the period of , so that the period of is , as seen in Figure .  Our observations generalize for any positive constant . In the case where , we saw that the period of is , whereas in the case where , the period of is . Identical reasoning holds if we are instead working with the cosine function. In general, we can say the following.   The period of a circular function  For any constant , the period of the functions and is .   Thus, if we know the -value from the given function, we can deduce the period. If instead we know the desired period, we can determine by the rule .    Determine the exact period, amplitude, and midline of each of the following functions. In addition, state the range of each function, any horizontal shift that has been introduced to the graph, and identify an anchor point. Make your conclusions without consulting Desmos , and then use the program to check your work.                                           Consider a spring-mass system where the weight is hanging from the ceiling in such a way that the following is known: we let denote the distance from the ceiling to the weight at time in seconds and know that the weight oscillates periodically with a minimum value of feet and a maximum value of feet, with a period of , and you know and .  State the midline, amplitude, range, and an anchor point for the function, and hence determine a formula for in the form or . Show your work and thinking, and use Desmos appropriately to check that your formula generates the desired behavior.              Summary     Given real numbers , , and with , the functions each represent a horizontal shift by units to the right, followed by a vertical stretch by units (with a reflection across the -axis if ), followed by a vertical shift of units, applied to the parent function ( or , respectively). The resulting circular functions have midline , amplitude , range , and period . In addition, the anchor point lies on the graph of and the anchor point lies on the graph of .    Given a function and a constant , the algebraic transformation results in horizontal scaling of by a factor of . In particular, when , the graph of is compressed toward the -axis by a factor of to create the graph of , while when , the graph of is stretched away from the -axis by a factor of to create the graph of .    Given any circular periodic function for which the midline, amplitude, period, and an anchor point are known, we can find a corresponding formula for the function of the form . Each of these functions has midline , amplitude , and period . The point lies on and the point lies on .

Your maximum height is 40 meters, so the amplitude is . The period is 8 minutes, so the constant . At , the 9 o'clock position would be halfway up the ferris wheel. We want the graph to be at its midline when , so we want to use the sine function.

  "body": " Exponential Growth and Decay     What does it mean to say that a function is exponential ?    How much data do we need to know in order to determine the formula for an exponential function?    Are there important trends that all exponential functions exhibit?      Linear functions have constant average rate of change and model many important phenomena. In other settings, it is natural for a quantity to change at a rate that is proportional to the amount of the quantity present. For instance, whether you put $ or $ or any other amount in a mutual fund, the investment's value changes at a rate proportional the amount present. We often measure that rate in terms of the annual percentage rate of return.  Suppose that a certain mutual fund has a % annual return. If we invest $ , after year we still have the original $ , plus we gain % of $ , so . If we instead invested $ , after year we again have the original $ , but now we gain % of $ , and thus . We therefore see that regardless of the amount of money originally invested, say , the amount of money we have after year is .  If we repeat our computations for the second year, we observe that . The ideas are identical with the larger dollar value, so , and we see that if we invest dollars, in years our investment will grow to .  Of course, in years at %, the original investment will have grown to . Here we see a new kind of pattern developing: annual growth of % is leading to powers of the base , where the power to which we raise corresponds to the number of years the investment has grown. We often call this phenomenon exponential growth . exponential growth introduction     Suppose that at age you have $ and you can choose between one of two ways to use the money: you can invest it in a mutual fund that will, on average, earn % interest annually, or you can purchase a new automobile that will, on average, depreciate % annually. Let's explore how the $ changes over time.  Let denote the value of the $ after years if it is invested in the mutual fund, and let denote the value of the automobile years after it is purchased.     Determine , , , and .    Note that if a quantity depreciates % annually, after a given year, % of the quantity remains. Compute , , , and .    Based on the patterns in your computations in (a) and (b), determine formulas for and .    Use Desmos to define and .

Each can be written in the form where and are positive constants and . Based on our earlier work with transformations, we know that the constant is a vertical scaling factor, and thus the main behavior of the function comes from , which we call an exponential function .   function exponential  exponential function base   Let be a real number such that and . We call the function defined by an exponential function with base  .    For an exponential function , we note that , so an exponential function of this form always passes through . In addition, because a positive number raised to any power is always positive (for instance, and ), the output of an exponential function is also always positive. In particular, is never zero and thus has no -intercepts.  Because we will be frequently interested in functions such as and with the form , we will also refer to functions of this form as exponential , understanding that technically these are vertical stretches of exponential functions according to Definition . In Preview Activity , we found that and . It is natural to call the growth factor of and similarly the growth factor of . In addition, we note that these values stem from the actual growth rates: for and for , the latter being negative because value is depreciating. In general, for a function of form , we call the growth factor . exponential function growth factor Moreover, if , we call the growth rate . exponential function growth rate Whenever , we often say that the function is exhibiting exponential growth , wherease if , we say exhibits exponential decay . exponential function exponential decay   We explore the properties of functions of form further in Activity .

Note that for to be an exponential function, we require , even though the slider for will allow this value.     What is the domain of ?    What is the range of ?    What is the -intercept of ?

Or that one of the values is less than ?   Graphs of exponential functions and .                   Determining formulas for exponential functions  To better understand the roles that and play in an exponential function, let's compare exponential and linear functions. In Table and Table , we see output for two different functions and that correspond to equally spaced input.    Data for the function .                    Data for the function .                    In Table , we see a function that exhibits constant average rate of change since the change in output is always for any change in input of . Said differently, is a linear function with slope . Since its -intercept is , the function's formula is .  In contrast, the function given by Table does not exhibit constant average rate of change. Instead, another pattern is present. Observe that if we consider the ratios of consecutive outputs in the table, we see that . So, where the differences in the outputs in Table are constant, the ratios in the outputs in Table are constant. The latter is a hallmark of exponential functions and may be used to help us determine the formula of a function for which we have certain information.  If we know that a certain function is linear, it suffices to know two points that lie on the line to determine the function's formula. It turns out that exponential functions are similar: knowing two points on the graph of a function known to be exponential is enough information to determine the function's formula. In the following example, we show how knowing two values of an exponential function enables us to find both and exactly.    Suppose that is an exponential function and we know that and . Determine the exact values of and for which .    Since we know that , the two data points give us two equations in the unknowns and . First, using , , and using we also have . Because we know that the quotient of outputs of an exponential function corresponding to equally-spaced inputs must be constant, we thus naturally consider the quotient . Using Equation and Equation , it follows that . Simplifying the fraction on the right, we see that . Solving for , we find that is the exact value of . Substituting this value for in Equation , it then follows that , so . Therefore, , and a plot of confirms that the function indeed passes through and as shown in Figure .   Plot of that passes through and .        The value of an automobile is depreciating. When the car is years old, its value is $ ; when the car is years old, its value is $ .     Suppose the car's value years after its purchase is given by the function and that is exponential with form , what are the values of and ? Find and both exactly and approximately.    Using the exponential model determined in (a), determine the purchase value of the car and then use Desmos estimate when the car will be worth less than $ .    Suppose instead that the car's value is modeled by a linear function and satisfies the values stated at the outset of this activity. Find a formula for and determine both the purchase value of the car and when the car will be worth $ .    Which model do you think is more realistic? Why?                 Trends in the behavior of exponential functions  Recall that a function is increasing on an interval if its value always increases as we move from left to right. Similarly, a function is decreasing on an interval provided that its value always decreases as we move from left to right.    The exponential function .     The exponential function .     If we consider an exponential function with a growth factor , such as the function pictured in Figure , then the function is always increasing because higher powers of are greater than lesser powers (for example, ). On the other hand, if , then the exponential function will be decreasing because higher powers of positive numbers less than get smaller (e.g., ), as seen for the exponential function in Figure .  An additional trend is apparent in the graphs in Figure and Figure . Each graph bends upward and is therefore concave up. We can better understand why this is so by considering the average rate of change of both and on consecutive intervals of the same width. We choose adjacent intervals of length and note particularly that as we compute the average rate of change of each function on such intervals, . Thus, these average rates of change are also measuring the total change in the function across an interval that is -unit wide. We now assume that and and compute the rate of change of each function on several consecutive intervals.    The average rate of change of .                               The average rate of change of .                               From the data in Table , we see that the average rate of change is increasing as we increase the value of . We naturally say that appears to be increasing at an increasing rate . For the function , we first notice that its average rate of change is always negative, but also that the average rate of change gets less negative as we increase the value of . Said differently, the average rate of change of is also increasing as we increase the value of . Since is always decreasing but its average rate of change is increasing, we say that appears to be decreasing at an increasing rate . These trends hold for exponential functions generally It takes calculus to justify this claim fully and rigorously. according to the following conditions.   Trends in exponential function behavior  For an exponential function of the form where and are both positive with ,   if , then is always increasing and always increases at an increasing rate;    if , then is always decreasing and always decreases at an increasing rate.      Observe how a function's average rate of change helps us classify the function's behavior on an interval: whether the average rate of change is always positive or always negative on the interval enables us to say if the function is always increasing or always decreasing, and then how the average rate of change itself changes enables us to potentially say how the function is increasing or decreasing through phrases such as decreasing at an increasing rate .    For each of the following prompts, give an example of a function that satisfies the stated characteristics by both providing a formula and sketching a graph.     A function that is always decreasing and decreases at a constant rate.    A function that is always increasing and increases at an increasing rate.    A function that is always increasing for , always decreasing for , and is always changing at a decreasing rate.    A function that is always increasing and increases at a decreasing rate. (Hint: to find a formula, think about how you might use a transformation of a familiar function.)    A function that is always decreasing and decreases at a decreasing rate.                 Summary     We say that a function is exponential whenever its algebraic form is for some positive constants and where . (Technically, the formal definition of an exponential function is one of form , but in our everyday usage of the term exponential we include vertical stretches of these functions and thus allow to be any positive constant, not just .)    To determine the formula for an exponential function of form , we need to know two pieces of information. Typically this information is presented in one of two ways.   If we know the amount, , of a quantity at time and the rate, , at which the quantity grows or decays per unit time, then it follows . In this setting, is often given as a percentage that we convert to a decimal (e.g., if the quantity grows at a rate of % per year, we set , so ).    If we know any two points on the exponential function's graph, then we can set up a system of two equations in two unknowns and solve for both and exactly. In this situation, it is useful to consider the quotient of the two known outputs, as demonstrated in Example .       Exponential functions of the form (where and are both positive and ) exhibit the following important characteristics:     The domain of any exponential function is the set of all real numbers and the range of any exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.    The -intercept of the exponential function is and the function has no -intercepts.    If , then the exponential function is always increasing and always increases at an increasing rate. If , then the exponential function is always decreasing and always decreases at an increasing rate.            Suppose .

If a movie ticket costs $9.00 today, find a formula for , the price of a movie ticket years from today, assuming that movie tickets keep up with inflation.    (b) According to your formula, how much will a movie ticket cost in years?             SOLUTION (a) We assume that the price of a movie ticket increases at the rate of 3.8% per year.

Whenever you need to enter several towns in one answer, enter your answer as a comma separated list of numbers.

(f) Which town has the smallest initial population?                                           SOLUTION The formula represents exponential growth if the base and exponential decay if . Towns 2, 5, 4 are growing and towns 6, 1, 3 are shrinking. Town 4 is growing the fastest since its growth factor of 1.187 is the largest. Since 1.187 - 1 = 0.187, it is growing at a rate of 18.7%. Town 1 is shrinking the fastest since its decay factor of 0.78 is the smallest. Since 1 - 0.78 = 0.22, it is shrinking at a rate of 22%. In the exponential function , the parameter gives the value of the function when .

SOLUTION (a) If a function is linear, then the differences in successive function values will be constant. If a function is exponential, the ratios of successive function values will remain constant. Now and (and similarly for the remaining intervals). Thus, is linear. We know that is linear, so for some constants and . We know that , so and .

  "body": " Modeling with exponential functions     What can we say about the behavior of an exponential function as the input gets larger and larger?    How do vertical stretches and shifts of an exponential function affect its behavior?    Why is the temperature of a cooling or warming object modeled by a function of the form ?      If a quantity changes so that its growth or decay occurs at a constant percentage rate with respect to time, the function is exponential. This is because if the growth or decay rate is , the total amount of the quantity at time is given by , where is the amount present at time . Many different natural quantities change according to exponential models: money growth through compounding interest, the growth of a population of cells, and the decay of radioactive elements.  A related situation arises when an object's temperature changes in response to its surroundings. For instance, if we have a cup of coffee at an initial temperature of Fahrenheit and the cup is placed in a room where the surrounding temperature is , our intuition and experience tell us that over time the coffee will cool and eventually tend to the temperature of the surroundings. From an experiment See http:\/\/gvsu.edu\/s\/0SB for this data. with an actual temperature probe, we have the data in Table that is plotted in Figure .   Data for cooling coffee, measured in degrees Fahrenheit at time in minutes.                                                   A plot of the data in Table .    In one sense, the data looks exponential: the points appear to lie on a curve that is always decreasing and decreasing at an increasing rate. However, we know that the function can't have the form because such a function's range is the set of all positive real numbers, and it's impossible for the coffee's temperature to fall below room temperature ( ). It is natural to wonder if a function of the form will work. Thus, in order to find a function that fits the data in a situation such as Figure , we begin by investigating and understanding the roles of , , and in the behavior of .    In Desmos , define and accept the prompt for sliders for , , and . Edit the sliders so that has values from to , has values from to , and has values from to (each with a step-size of 0.01). In addition, in Desmos let and check the box to show the label. Finally, zoom out so that the window shows an interval of -values from .     Set and explore the effects of changing the values of and . Write several sentences to summarize your observations.    Follow the directions for (a) again, this time with     Set and . Explore the effects of changing the value of ; be sure to include values of both less than and greater than 1. Write several sentences to summarize your observations.    When , what happens to the graph of when we consider positive -values that get larger and larger?         Long-term behavior of exponential functions  We have already established that any exponential function of the form where and are positive real numbers with is always concave up and is either always increasing or always decreasing. We next introduce precise language to describe the behavior of an exponential function's value as gets bigger and bigger. To start, let's consider the two basic exponential functions and and their respective values at , , and , as displayed in Table and Table .    Data for .                      Data for .                      For the increasing function , we see that the output of the function gets very large very quickly. In addition, there is no upper bound to how large the function can be. Indeed, we can make the value of as large as we'd like by taking sufficiently big. We thus say that as increases,  increases without bound . increasing without bound   For the decreasing function , we see that the output is always positive but getting closer and closer to . Indeed, because we can make as large as we like, it follows that we can make its reciprocal as small as we'd like. We thus say that as increases,  approaches . approaching   To represent these two common phenomena with exponential functions the value increasing without bound or the value approaching we will use shorthand notation. First, it is natural to write as increases without bound. Moreover, since we have the notion of the infinite to represent quantities without bound, we use the symbol for infinity and arrow notation infinity ( ) and write as increases without bound in order to indicate that increases without bound.  In Preview Activity , we saw how the value of affects the steepness of the graph of , as well as how all graphs with have the similar increasing behavior, and all graphs with have similar decreasing behavior. For instance, by taking sufficiently large, we can make as large as we want; it just takes much larger to make big in comparison to . In the same way, we can make as close to as we wish by taking sufficiently big, even though it takes longer for to get close to in comparison to . For an arbitrary choice of , we can say the following.   Long-term behavior of exponential functions  Let with and .   If , then as . We read this notation as tends to as increases without bound.     If , then as . We read this notation as increases without bound as increases without bound.       In addition, we make a key observation about the use of exponents. For the function , there are three equivalent ways we may write the function: . In our work with transformations involving horizontal scaling in Exercise , we saw that the graph of is the reflection of the graph of across the -axis. Therefore, we can say that the graphs of and are reflections of one another in the -axis since . We see this fact verified in Figure .   Plots of and .    Similar observations hold for the relationship between the graphs of and for any positive .    The role of in  The function is a vertical translation of the function . We now have extensive understanding of the behavior of and how that behavior depends on and . Since a vertical translation by does not change the shape of any graph, we expect that will exhibit very similar behavior to . Indeed, we can compare the two functions' graphs as shown in Figure and Figure and then make the following general observations.    Plot of .     Plot of .      Behavior of vertically shifted exponential functions  Let with , and , and any real number.   If , then as . The function is always decreasing, always concave up, and has -intercept . The range of the function is all real numbers greater than .    If , then as . The function is always increasing, always concave up, and has -intercept . The range of the function is all real numbers greater than .      It is also possible to have . In this situation, because is both a reflection of across the -axis and a vertical stretch by , the function is always concave down. If so that is always decreasing, then is always increasing; if instead so is increasing, then is decreasing. Moreover, instead of the range of the function having a lower bound as when , in this setting the range of has an upper bound. These ideas are explored further in Activity .  It's an important skill to be able to look at an exponential function of the form and form an accurate mental picture of the graph's main features in light of the values of , , and .    For each of the following functions, without using graphing technology, determine whether the function is   always increasing or always decreasing;    always concave up or always concave down; and    increasing without bound, decreasing without bound, or increasing\/decreasing toward a finite value.   In addition, state the -intercept and the range of the function. For each function, write a sentence that explains your thinking and sketch a rough graph of how the function appears.                                                Modeling temperature data  Newton's Law of Cooling Newton's Law of Cooling states that the rate that an object warms or cools occurs in direct proportion to the difference between its own temperature and the temperature of its surroundings. If we return to the coffee temperature data in Table and recall that the room temperature in that experiment was , we can see how to use a transformed exponential function to model the data. In Table , we add a row of information to the table where we compute to subtract the room temperature from each reading.   Data for cooling coffee, measured in degrees Fahrenheit at time in minutes, plus shifted to account for room temperature.                                                     The data in the bottom row of Table appears exponential, and if we test the data by computing the quotients of output values that correspond to equally-spaced input, we see a nearly constant ratio. In particular, . Of course, there is some measurement error in the data (plus it is only recorded to accuracy of whole degrees), so these computations provide convincing evidence that the underlying function is exponential. In addition, we expect that if the data continued in the bottom row of Table , the values would approach because will approach .    Plot of .     Plot of .     If we choose two of the data points, say and , and assume that , we can determine the values of and . Doing so, it turns out that and , so . Since , we see that , so . Plotting against the shifted data and along with the original data in Figure and Figure , we see that the curves go exactly through the points where and as expected, but also that the function provides a reasonable model for the observed behavior at any time . If our data was even more accurate, we would expect that the curve's fit would be even better.  Our preceding work with the coffee data can be done similarly with data for any cooling or warming object whose temperature initially differs from its surroundings. Indeed, it is possible to show that Newton's Law of Cooling implies that the object's temperature is given by a function of the form .    A can of soda (at room temperature) is placed in a refrigerator at time (in minutes) and its temperature, , in degrees Fahrenheit, is computed at regular intervals. Based on the data, a model is formulated for the object's temperature, given by .     Consider the simpler (parent) function . How do you expect the graph of this function to appear? How will it behave as time increases? Without using graphing technology, sketch a rough graph of and write a sentence of explanation.    For the slightly more complicated function , how do you expect this function to look in comparison to ? What is the long-range behavior of this function as increases? Without using graphing technology, sketch a rough graph of and write a sentence of explanation.    Finally, how do you expect the graph of to appear? Why? First sketch a rough graph without graphing technology, and then use technology to check your thinking and report an accurate, labeled graph on the axes provided in Figure .   Axes for plotting .      What is the temperature of the refrigerator? What is the room temperature of the surroundings outside the refrigerator? Why?    Determine the average rate of change of on the intervals , , and . Write at least two careful sentences that explain the meaning of the values you found, including units, and discuss any overall trend in how the average rate of change is changing.

It is known that the potato's temperature at time is given by the function for some positive constants and , where is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and is time in minutes.

Use this fact along with the behavior of to determine the value of . Write a sentence to explain your thinking.    What is the value of ? Why?    Check your work above by plotting the function using graphing technology in an appropriate window. Record your results on the axes provided in Figure , labeling the scale on the axes. Then, use the graph to estimate the time at which the potato's temperature reaches degrees.   Axes for plotting .      How can we view the function as a transformation of the parent function ? Explain.                 Summary     For an exponential function of the form , the function either approaches zero or grows without bound as the input gets larger and larger. In particular, if , then as , while if , then as . Scaling by a positive value (that is, the transformed function ) does not affect the long-range behavior: whether the function tends to or increases without bound depends solely on whether is less than or greater than .    The function passes through , is always concave up, is either always increasing or always decreasing, and its range is the set of all positive real numbers. Among these properties, a vertical stretch by a positive value only affects the -intercept, which is instead . If we include a vertical shift and write , the biggest change is that the range of is the set of all real numbers greater than . In addition, the -intercept of is .  In the situation where , several other changes are induced. Here, because is both a reflection of across the -axis and a vertical stretch by , the function is now always concave down. If so that is always decreasing, then (the reflected function) is now always increasing; if instead so is increasing, then is decreasing. Finally, if , then the range of is the set of all real numbers less than .    An exponential function can be thought of as a function that changes at a rate proportional to itself, like how money grows with compound interest or the amount of a radioactive quantity decays. Newton's Law of Cooling says that the rate of change of an object's temperature is proportional to the difference between its own temperature and the temperature of its surroundings. This leads to the function that measures the difference between the object's temperature and room temperature being exponential, and hence the object's temperature itself is a vertically-shifted exponential function of the form .

  "body": " The special number     Why can every exponential function of form (where and ) be thought of as a horizontal scaling of a single special exponential function?    What is the natural base and what makes this number special?      We have observed that the behavior of functions of the form is very consistent, where the only major differences depend on whether or . Indeed, if we stipulate that , the graphs of functions with different bases look nearly identical, as seen in the plots of , , , and in Figure .   Plots of four different exponential functions of form with .    Because the point lies on the graph of each of the four functions in Figure , the functions cannot be vertical scalings of one another. However, it is possible that the functions are horizontal scalings of one another. This leads us to a natural question: might it be possible to find a single exponential function with a special base, say , for which every other exponential function can be expressed as a horizontal scaling of ?    Open a new Desmos worksheet and define the following functions: , , , and . After you define , accept the slider for , and set the range of the slider to be .     By experimenting with the value of , find a value of so that the graph of appears to align with the graph of . What is the value of ?    Similarly, experiment to find a value of so that the graph of appears to align with the graph of . What is the value of ?    For the value of you determined in (a), compute . What do you observe?    For the value of you determined in (b), compute . What do you observe?    Given any exponential function of the form , do you think it's possible to find a value of to that is the same function as ? Why or why not?         The natural base  In Preview Activity , we found that it appears possible to find a value of so that given any base , we can write the function as the horizontal scaling of given by . It's also apparent that there's nothing particularly special about : we could similarly write any function as a horizontal scaling of or , albeit with a different scaling factor for each. Thus, we might also ask: is there a best possible single base to use?  Through the central topic of the rate of change of a function, calculus helps us decide which base is best to use to represent all exponential functions. While we study average rate of change extensively in this course, in calculus there is more emphasis on the instantaneous rate of change. In that context, a natural question arises: is there a nonzero function that grows in such a way that its height is exactly how fast its height is increasing?  Amazingly, it turns out that the answer to this questions is yes, and the function with this property is the exponential function with the natural base , denoted . The number (named in homage to the great Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler (1707-1783)) is complicated to define. Like , is an irrational number that cannot be represented exactly by a ratio of integers and whose decimal expansion never repeats. Advanced mathematics is needed in order to make the following formal definition of .   The natural base,  exponential function with the natural base,  natural base,  e   The number is the infinite sum Infinite sums are usually studied in second semester calculus.  From this, .    For instance, is an approximation of generated by taking the first terms in the infinite sum that defines it. Every computational device knows the number and we will normally work with this number by using technology appropriately.  Initially, it's important to note that , and thus we expect the function to lie between and .    Select outputs of , , and reported to decimal places.                                                                      Plot of along with and .     If we compare the graphs and some selected outputs of each function, as in Table and Figure , we see that the function satisfies the inequality for all positive values of . When is negative, we can view the values of each function as being reciprocals of powers of , , and . For instance, since , it follows , or . Thus, for any , Like and , the function passes through is always increasing and always concave up, and its range is the set of all positive real numbers.    Recall from Section that the average rate of change of a function on an interval is . In Section , we also saw that if we instead think of the average rate of change of on the interval , the expression changes to . In this activity we explore the average rate of change of near the points where and .  In a new Desmos worksheet, let and define the function by the rule .     What is the meaning of in terms of the function and its graph?    Compute the value of for at least different small values of , both positive and negative. For instance, one value to try might be . Record a table of your results.    What do you notice about the values you found in (b)? How do they compare to an important number?    Explain why the following sentence makes sense: The function is increasing at an average rate that is about the same as its value on small intervals near .     Adjust your definition of in Desmos by changing to so that . How does the value of compare to for small values of ?                 Why any exponential function can be written in terms of  In Preview Activity , we saw graphical evidence that any exponential function can be written as a horizontal scaling of the function , plus we observed that there wasn't anything particularly special about . Because of the importance of in calculus, we will choose instead to use the natural exponential function, as the function we scale to generate any other exponential function . We claim that for any choice of (with ), there exists a horizontal scaling factor such that .  By the rules of exponents, we can rewrite this last equation equivalently as . Since this equation has to hold for every value of , it follows that . Thus, our claim that we can scale to get requires us to show that regardless of the choice of the positive number , there exists a single corresponding value of such that .  Given , we can always find a corresponding value of such that because the function passes the , as seen in Figure .   A plot of along with several choices of positive constants viewed on the vertical axis.    In Figure , we can think of as a point on the positive vertical axis. From there, we draw a horizontal line over to the graph of , and then from the (unique) point of intersection we drop a vertical line to the -axis. At that corresponding point on the -axis we have found the input value that corresponds to . We see that there is always exactly one such value that corresponds to each chosen because is always increasing, and any always increasing function passes the Horizontal Line Test.  It follows that the function has an inverse function, and hence there must be some other function such that writing is the same as writing . This important function will be developed in Section and will enable us to find the value of exactly for a given . For now, we are content to work with these observations graphically and to hence find estimates for the value of .    By graphing and appropriate horizontal lines, estimate the solution to each of the following equations. Note that in some parts, you may need to do some algebraic work in addition to using the graph.                                                Summary    Any exponential function can be viewed as a horizontal scaling of because there exists a unique constant such that is true for every value of . This holds since the exponential function is always increasing, so given an output there exists a unique input such that , from which it follows that .    The natural base is the special number that defines an increasing exponential function whose rate of change at any point is the same as its height at that point, a fact that is established using calculus. The number turns out to be given exactly by an infinite sum and approximately by .

  "body": " What a logarithm is     How is the base- logarithm defined?    What is the natural logarithm and how is it different from the base- logarithm?    How can we solve an equation that involves to some unknown quantity?      In Section , we introduced the idea of an inverse function. The fundamental idea is that has an inverse function if and only if there exists another function such that and  undo one another's respective processes. In other words, the process of the function is reversible, and reversing generates a related function .  More formally, recall that a function (where ) has an inverse function if and only if there exists another function such that for every in , and for every in . We know that given a function , we can use the to determine whether or not has an inverse function. Finally, whenever a function has an inverse function, we call its inverse function and know that the two equations and say the same thing from different perspectives.    Let be the powers of 10 function, which is given by .     Complete Table to generate certain values of .   Select values of the powers of function.     -3  -2  -1  0  1  2  3                 Why does have an inverse function?    Since has an inverse function, we know there exists some other function, say , such that writing says the exact same thing as writing . In words, where produces the result of raising to a given power, the function reverses this process and instead tells us the power to which we need to raise , given a desired result. Complete Table to generate a collection of values of .   Select values of the function that is the inverse of .                                     What are the domain and range of the function ? What are the domain and range of the function ?         The base- logarithm  The powers-of- function is an exponential function with base . As such, is always increasing, and thus its graph passes the , so has an inverse function. We therefore know there exists some other function, , such that writing is equivalent to writing . For instance, we know that and , so it's equivalent to say that and . This new function we call the base logarithm , which is formally defined as follows.   logarithm base definition   Given a positive real number , the base- logarithm of is the power to which we raise to get . We use the notation to denote the base- logarithm of .    The base- logarithm is therefore the inverse of the powers of function. Whereas takes an input whose value is an exponent and produces the result of taking to that power, the base- logarithm takes an input number we view as a power of and produces the corresponding exponent such that to that exponent is the input number.  In the notation of logarithms, we can now update our earlier observations with the functions and and see how exponential equations can be written in two equivalent ways. For instance, each say the same thing from two different perspectives. The first says is to the power , while the second says is the power to which we raise to get . Similarly, .  If we rearrange the statements of the facts in Equation , we can see yet another important relationship between the powers of and base- logarithm function. Noting that and are equivalent statements, and substituting the latter equation into the former, we see that . In words, Equation says that the power to which we raise to get , is . That is, the base- logarithm function undoes the work of the powers of function.  In a similar way, if we rearrange the statements in Equation , we can observe that by replacing with we have . In words, Equation says that when is raised to the power to which we raise in order to get , we get .  We summarize the key relationships between the powers-of- function and its inverse, the base- logarithm function, more generally as follows.   and     The domain of is the set of all real numbers and the range of is the set of all positive real numbers.    The domain of is the set of all positive real numbers and the range of is the set of all real numbers.    For any real number , . That is, .    For any positive real number , . That is, .     and .      The base- logarithm function is like the sine or cosine function in this way: for certain special values, it's easy to know the value of the logarithm function. While for sine and cosine the familiar points come from specially placed points on the unit circle, for the base- logarithm function, the familiar points come from powers of . In addition, like sine and cosine, for all other input values, (a) calculus ultimately determines the value of the base- logarithm function at other values, and (b) we use computational technology in order to compute these values. For most computational devices, the command log(y) produces the result of the base- logarithm of .  It's important to note that the logarithm function produces exact values. For instance, if we want to solve the equation , then it follows that is the exact solution to the equation. Like or , is a number that is an exact value. A computational device can give us a decimal approximation, and we normally want to distinguish between the exact value and the approximate one. For the three different numbers here, , , and .    For each of the following equations, determine the exact value of the unknown variable. If the exact value involves a logarithm, use a computational device to also report an approximate value. For instance, if the exact value is , you can also note that .                                                     The natural logarithm  The base- logarithm is a good starting point for understanding how logarithmic functions work because powers of are easy to mentally compute. We could similarly consider the powers of or powers of function and develop a corresponding logarithm of base or . But rather than have a whole collection of different logarithm functions, in the same way that we now use the function and appropriate scaling to represent any exponential function, we develop a single logarithm function that we can use to represent any other logarithmic function through scaling. In correspondence with the natural exponential function, , we now develop its inverse function, and call this inverse function the natural logarithm .   logarithm natural definition   Given a positive real number , the natural logarithm of is the power to which we raise to get . We use the notation to denote the natural logarithm of .    We can think of the natural logarithm, , as the base- logarithm . For instance, and . The former equation is true since the power to which we raise to get is ; the latter equation is true since when we raise to the power to which we raise to get , we get . The key relationships between the natural exponential and the natural logarithm function are investigated in Activity .    Let and be the natural exponential function and the natural logarithm function, respectively.     What are the domain and range of ?    What are the domain and range of ?    What can you say about for every real number ?    What can you say about for every positive real number ?    Complete Table and Table with both exact and approximate values of and . Then, plot the corresponding ordered pairs from each table on the axes provided in Figure and connect the points in an intuitive way. When you plot the ordered pairs on the axes, in both cases view the first line of the table as generating values on the horizontal axis and the second line of the table as producing values on the vertical axis Note that when we take this perspective for plotting the data in Table , we are viewing as a function of , writing in order to plot the function on the - axes ; label each ordered pair you plot appropriately.

Furthermore, once we introduced the natural base in Section , we realized that we could write every exponential function of form as a horizontal scaling of the function by writing for some value . Our development of the natural logarithm function in the current section enables us to now determine exactly.    Determine the exact value of for which .   Solution . Since we want to hold for every value of and , we need to have , and thus . Therefore, is the power to which we raise to get , which by definition means that .    In modeling important phenomena using exponential functions, we will frequently encounter equations where the variable is in the exponent, like in Example where we had to solve . It is in this context where logarithms find one of their most powerful applications. Activity provides some opportunities to practice solving equations involving the natural base, , and the natural logarithm.    Solve each of the following equations for the exact value of the unknown variable. If there is no solution to the equation, explain why not.                                                          Summary    The base- logarithm of , denoted , is defined to be the power to which we raise to get . For instance, , since . The function is thus the inverse of the powers-of- function, .    The natural logarithm differs from the base- logarithm in that it is the logarithm with base instead of , and thus is the power to which we raise to get . The function is the inverse of the natural exponential function .    The natural logarithm often enables us to solve an equation that involves to some unknown quantity. For instance, to solve , we can first solve for by subtracting from each side and dividing by to get . This last equation says to some power is . We know that it is equivalent to say .

When , we know its inverse is . Through logarithms, we now have the ability to find the inverse of many different exponential functions.

In addition, state the domain and range of the given function and the domain and range of the inverse function.

What are the key properties of the graph of the natural logarithm function?    How do logarithms enable us to solve exponential equations?      Logarithms arise as inverses of exponential functions. In addition, we have motivated their development by our desire to solve exponential equations such as for . Because of the inverse relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions, there are several important properties logarithms have that are analogous to ones held by exponential functions. We will work to develop these properties and then show how they are useful in applied settings.    In the following questions, we investigate how can be equivalently written in terms of and .     Write as raised to a single power. That is, complete the equation by filling in the box with an appropriate expression involving and .    What is the simplest possible way to write ? What about the simplest equivalent expression for ?    Explain why each of the following three equal signs is valid in the sequence of equalities: .   Suppose that and are positive real numbers, so we can think of as for some real number and as for some real number . That is, say that and . What does our work in (c) tell us about ?        Key properties of logarithms  In Preview Activity , we considered an argument for why for any choice of positive numbers and . In what follows, we develop this and other properties of the natural logarithm function; similar reasoning shows the same properties hold for logarithms of any base.  Let and be any positive real numbers so that and are both defined. Observe that we can rewrite these two equations using the definition of the natural logarithm so that . Using substitution, we can now say that . By exponent rules, we know that , and because the natural logarithm and natural exponential function are inverses, . Combining the three most recent equations, . Finally, recalling that and , we have shown that for any choice of positive real numbers and .  A similar property holds for . By nearly the same argument, we can say that .  We have thus shown the following general principles.   Logarithms of products and quotients  logarithm of a product  logarithm of a quotient  For any positive real numbers and ,           Because positive integer exponents are a shorthand way to express repeated multiplication, we can use the multiplication rule for logarithms to think about exponents as well. For example, , and by repeated application of the rule for the natural logarithm of a product, we see . A similar argument works to show that for every natural number , . More sophisticated mathematics can be used to prove that the following property holds for every real number exponent .   Logarithms of exponential expressions  For any positive real number and any real number , .   The rule that is extremely powerful: by working with logarithms appropriately, it enables us to move from having a variable in an exponential expression to the variable being part of a linear expression. Moreover, it enables us to solve exponential equations exactly, regardless of the base involved.    Solve the equation exactly for .    To solve for , we first solve for . Adding to both sides and dividing by , we find that . Next, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation. Doing so, we have . Applying the rule for the logarithm of an exponential expression on the left, we see that . Both and are simply numbers, and thus we conclude that .    The approach used in Example works in a wide range of settings: any time we have an exponential equation of the form , we can solve for by first isolating the exponential expression and then by taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation.    Solve each of the following equations exactly and then find an estimate that is accurate to 5 decimal places.                                                The graph of the natural logarithm  As the inverse of the natural exponential function , we have already established that the natural logarithm has the set of all positive real numbers as its domain and the set of all real numbers as its range. In addition, being the inverse of , we know that when we plot the natural logarithm and natural exponential functions on the same coordinate axes, their graphs are reflections of one another across the line , as seen in Figure and Figure .    The natural exponential and natural logarithm functions on the interval .     The natural exponential and natural logarithm functions on the interval .     Indeed, for any point that lies on the graph of , it follows that the point lies on the graph of the inverse . From this, we see several important properties of the graph of the logarithm function.   The graph of  The graph of    passes through the point ;    is always increasing;    is always concave down; and    increases without bound.      Because the graph of increases more and more rapidly as increases, the graph of increases more and more slowly as increases. Even though the natural logarithm function grows very slowly, it does grow without bound because we can make as large as we want by making sufficiently large. For instance, if we want such that , we choose , since .  While the natural exponential function and the natural logarithm (and transformations of these functions) are connected and have certain similar properties, it's also important to be able to distinguish between behavior that is fundamentally exponential and fundamentally logarithmic.    In the questions that follow, we compare and contrast the properties and behaviors of exponential and logarithmic functions.     Let and . Plot each function on the same set of coordinate axes. What properties do the two functions have in common? For what properties do the two functions differ?

Putting logarithms to work  We've seen in several different settings that the function plays a key role in modeling phenomena in the world around us. We also understand that the value of controls whether is increasing ( ) or decreasing ( ) and how fast the function is increasing or decreasing. As such, we often need to determine the value of from data that is presented to us; doing so almost always requires the use of logarithms.

Suppose that the number of cells, , in the population is measured in millions of cells and we know that and . Find a model of the form that fits this data and use it to determine the value of and how long it will take for the population to reach billion cells.    Since the model has form , we know that .

The natural logarithm's domain is the set of all positive real numbers and its range is the set of all real numbers. Its graph passes through , is always increasing, is always concave down, and increases without bound.

  "body": " Modeling temperature and population     What roles do the parameters , , and play in how the function models the temperature of an object that is cooling or warming in its surroundings?    How can we use an exponential function to more realistically model a population whose growth levels off?      We've seen that exponential functions can be used to model several different important phenomena, such as the growth of money due to continuously compounded interest, the decay of radioactive quanitities, and the temperature of an object that is cooling or warming due to its surroundings. From initial work with functions of the form where and , we found that shifted exponential functions of form are also important. Moreover, the special base allows us to represent all of these functions through horizontal scaling by writing where is the constant such that . Functions of the form of Equation are either always increasing or always decreasing, always have the same concavity, are defined on the set of all real numbers, and have their range as the set of all real numbers greater than or all real numbers less than . In whatever setting we are using a model of this form, the crucial task is to identify the values of , , and ; that endeavor is the focus of this section.  We have also begun to see the important role that logarithms play in work with exponential models. The natural logarithm is the inverse of the natural exponential function and satisfies the important rule that . This rule enables us to solve equations with the structure for in the context where and are known but is not. Indeed, we can first take the natural log of both sides of the equation to get , from which it follows that , and therefore . Finding is often central to determining an exponential model, and logarithms make finding the exact value of possible.  In Preview Activity , we revisit some key algebraic ideas with exponential and logarithmic equations in preparation for using these concepts in models for temperature and population.    In each of the following situations, determine the exact value of the unknown quantity that is identified.     The temperature of a warming object in an oven is given by , and we know that the object's temperature after minutes is . Determine the exact value of .    The temperature of a cooling object in a refrigerator is modeled by , and the temperature of the refrigerator is . By thinking about the long-term behavior of and the long-term behavior of the object's temperature, determine the exact value of .    Later in this section, we'll learn that one model for how a population grows over time can be given by a function of the form . Models of this form lead naturally to equations that have structure like Solve Equation for the exact value of .    Suppose that . Solve for in terms of , , , and . What does this new equation represent?         Newton's Law of Cooling revisited  In Section , we learned that Newton's Law of Cooling, which states that an object's temperature changes at a rate proportional to the difference between its own temperature and the surrounding temperature, results in the object's temperature being modeled by functions of the form . In light of our subsequent work in Section with the natural base , as well as the fact that in this model, we know that Newton's Law of Cooling implies that the object's temperature is modeled by a function of the form for some constants , , and , where .  From Equation , we can determine several different characteristics of how the constants , , and are connected to the behavior of by thinking about what happens at , at one additional value of , and as increases without bound. In particular, note that will tend to as increases without bound.   Modeling temperature with Newton's Law of Cooling  For the function that models the temperature of a cooling or warming object, the constants , , and play the following roles. Note that .   Since tends to as increases without bound, tends to as increases without bound, and thus represents the temperature of the object's surroundings.    Since , , and thus the object's initial temperature is . Said differently, is the difference between the object's initial temperature and the temperature of the surroundings.    Once we know the values of and , the value of is determined by knowing the value of the temperature function at one nonzero value of .        A can of soda is initially at room temperature, Fahrenheit, and at time is placed in a refrigerator set at . In addition, we know that after minutes, the soda's temperature has dropped to . Let represent the temperature of the soda in degrees Fahrenheit at time in minutes.     Use algebraic reasoning and your understanding of the physical situation to determine the exact values of , , and in the model . Write at least one careful sentence to explain your thinking.    Determine the exact time the object's temperature is . Clearly show your algebraic work and thinking.    In Desmos , enter the values you found for , , and in order to define the function . Then, use Desmos to find the average rate of change of on the interval . What is the meaning (with units) of this value?    If everything stayed the same except the value of , and instead , would the value of be larger or smaller? Why?                 A more realistic model for population growth  If we assume that a population grows at a rate that is proportionate to the size of the population, it follows that the population grows exponentially according to the model where is the initial population and is tied to the rate at which the population grows. Since , we know that is an always increasing, always concave up function that grows without bound. While may be a reasonable model for how a population grows when it is relatively small, because the function grows without bound as time increases, it can't be a realistic long-term representation of what happens in reality. Indeed, whether it is the number of fish who can survive in a lake, the number of cells in a petri dish, or the number of human beings on earth, the size of the surroundings and the limitations of resources will keep the population from being able to grow without bound.  In light of these observations, a different model is needed for population, one that grows exponentially at first, but that levels off later. Calculus can be used to develop such a model, and the resulting function is usually called the logistic function , logistic function which has form , where , , and are positive constants. Since , it follows that as increases without bound, and thus the denominator of approaches as time goes on. Thus, we observe that tends to as increases without bound.

Show your algebraic work and thinking.                 Summary    When a function of form models the temperature of an object that is cooling or warming in its surroundings, the temperature of the surroundings is because as time goes on, the object's initial temperature is , and the constant is connected to how rapidly the object's temperature changes. Once and are known, the constant can be determined by knowing the temperature at one additional time, .    Because the exponential function grows without bound as increases, such a function is not a realistic model of a population that we expect to level off as time goes on. The logistic function more appropriately models a population that grows roughly exponentially when is small but whose size levels off as it approaches the carrying capacity of the surrounding environment, which is the value of the constant .         Newton's law of cooling states that the temperature of an object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between its temperature and that of its surroundings. Suppose that the temperature of a cup of coffee obeys Newton's law of cooling. If the coffee has a temperature of degrees Fahrenheit when freshly poured, and minutes later has cooled to degrees in a room at degrees, determine when the coffee reaches a temperature of degrees.  The coffee will reach a temperature of degrees in minutes.               The total number of people infected with a virus often grows like a logistic curve. Suppose that 25 people originally have the virus, and that in the early stages of the virus (with time, , measured in weeks), the number of people infected is increasing exponentially with . It is estimated that, in the long run, approximately 7250 people become infected.  (a) Use this information to find a logistic function to model this situation.    (b) Sketch a graph of your answer to part (a). Use your graph to estimate the length of time until the rate at which people are becoming infected starts to decrease. What is the vertical coordinate at this point?  vertical coordinate =             (a) We know that a logistic curve can be modeled by the function where and is the number of people infected by the virus at a particular time . We know that is the limiting value, or the maximal number of people infected with the virus, so in our case We are also told that initially there are only 25 people infected with the virus so that we get Thus we have We are also told that in the early stages of the virus, infection grows exponentially with . Thus we get that the logistic function for people infected is  (b) Graphing this solution, we see Looking at the graph we see that the the point at which the rate changes from increasing to decreasing, the inflection point, occurs at roughly giving a value of . Thus after roughly 3750 people have been infected, the rate of infection starts dropping.      In Exercise below, use the following structure\/formula for : . In particular, note that when the instructions say find , this use of is not in reference to carrying capacity.

Find the number of people infected after 30 days.                       A glass filled with ice and water is set on a table in a climate-controlled room with constant temperature of Fahrenheit. A temperature probe is placed in the glass, and we find that the following temperatures are recorded (at time in minutes).                   Make a rough sketch of how you think the temperature graph should appear. Is the temperature function always increasing? always decreasing? always concave up? always concave down? what's its long-range behavior?

Exercise Answer   Exercise Solution    A popular cruise ship sets sail in the Gulf of Mexico with passengers and crew on board. Unfortunately, a five family members who board the ship are carrying a highly contagious virus. After interacting with many other passengers in the first few hours of the cruise, all five of them get very sick.  Let be the number of people who have acquired the virus days after the ship has left port. It turns out that a logistic function is a good model for , and thus we assume that for some positive constants , , and . Suppose that after day, people have gotten the virus.

Exercise Answer   Exercise Solution    A closed tank with an inflow and outflow contains a liters of saltwater solution. Let the amount of salt in the tank at time (in minutes) be given by the function , whose output is measured in grams. At time there is an initial amount of salt present in the tank, and the inflow line also carries a saltwater mixture to the tank at a fixed rate; the outflow occurs at the same rate and carries a perfectly mixed solution out of the tank. Because of these conditions, the volume of solution in the tank stays fixed over time, but the amount of salt possibly changes.  It turns out that the problem of determining the amount of salt in the tank at time is similar to the problem of determining the temperature of a warming or cooling object, and that the function has form for constants , , and . Suppose that for a particular set of conditions, we know that . Again, measures the amount of salt in the tank after minutes.     How much salt is in the tank initially?    In the long run, how much salt do we expect to eventually be in the tank?    At what exact time are there exactly grams of salt present in the tank?    Can you determine the concentration of the solution that is being delivered by the inflow to the tank? If yes, explain why and determine this value. If not, explain why that information cannot be found without additional data.      Exercise Answer   Exercise Solution      "

  "body": " Right triangles     How can we view and as side lengths in right triangles with hypotenuse ?    Why can both and be thought of as ratios of certain side lengths in any right triangle?    What is the minimum amount of information we need about a right triangle in order to completely determine all of its sides and angles?      In Section , we defined the cosine and sine functions as the functions that track the location of a point traversing the unit circle counterclockwise from . In particular, for a central angle of radian measure that passes through the point , we define as the -coordinate of the point where the other side of the angle intersects the unit circle, and as the -coordinate of that same point, as pictured in Figure .  By changing our perspective slightly, we can see that it is equivalent to think of the values of the sine and cosine function as representing the lengths of legs in right triangles. Specifically, given a central angle In our work with right triangles, we'll often represent the angle by and think of this angle as fixed, as opposed to our previous use of where we frequently think of as changing.  in standard position standard position (vertex at the origin, and one side on the positive -axis), if we think of the right triangle with vertices , , and , then the length of the horizontal leg is and the length of the vertical leg is , as seen in Figure .    The values of and as coordinates on the unit circle.     The values of and as the lengths of the legs of a right triangle.     This right triangle perspective enables us to use the sine and cosine functions to determine missing information in certain right triangles. The field of mathematics that studies relationships among the angles and sides of triangles is called trigonometry . trigonometry In addition, it's important to recall both the Pythagorean Theorem and the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity. Pythagorean Theorem  fundamental trigonometric identity The former states that in any right triangle with legs of length and and hypotenuse of length , it follows . The latter, which is a special case of the Pythagorean Theorem, says that for any angle , .    For each of the following situations, sketch a right triangle that satisfies the given conditions, and then either determine the requested missing information in the triangle or explain why you don't have enough information to determine it. Assume that all angles are being considered in radian measure.     The length of the other leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length and one leg of length .    The lengths of the two legs in a right triangle with hypotenuse of length where one of the non-right angles measures .    The length of the other leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length and one leg of length .    The lengths of the two legs in a right triangle with hypotenuse and where one of the non-right angles measures .    The length of the other leg of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length and one leg of length .    The measures of the two angles in a right triangle with hypotenuse of length where the two legs have lengths and , respectively.         The geometry of triangles  In the study of functions, linear functions are the simplest of all and form a foundation for our understanding of functions that have other shapes. In the study of geometric shapes (polygons, circles, and more), the simplest figure of all is the triangle, and understanding triangles is foundational to understanding many other geometric ideas. To begin, we list some familiar and important facts about triangles.     Any triangle has important features: sides and angles.    In any triangle in the Cartesian plane, the sum of the measures of the interior angles is radians (or equivalently, ).    In any triangle in the plane, knowing three of the six features of a triangle is often enough information to determine the missing three features. Formally, this idea relies on what are called congruence criteria . For instance, if we know the lengths of all three sides, then the angle measures of the triangle are uniquely determined. This is called the Side-Side-Side Criterion (SSS). You are likely familiar with SSS, as well as SAS (Side-Angle-Side), ASA, and AAS, which are the four standard criteria.      The situation is especially nice for right triangles, because then we only have five unknown features since one of the angles is radians (or ), as demonstrated in Figure . If we know one of the two non-right angles, then we know the other as well. Moreover, if we know any two sides, we can immediately deduce the third, because of the Pythagorean Theorem. As we saw in Preview Activity , the cosine and sine functions offer additional help in determining missing information in right triangles. Indeed, while the functions and have many important applications in modeling periodic phenomena such as osciallating masses on springs, they also find powerful application in settings involving right triangles, such as in navigation and surveying.   The potential unknowns in a right triangle.    Because we know the values of the cosine and sine functions from the unit circle, right triangles with hypotentuse are the easiest ones in which to determine missing information. In addition, we can relate any other right triangle to a right triangle with hypotenuse through the concept of similarity . Recall that two triangles are similar  similar triangles provided that one is a magnification of the other. More precisely, two triangles are similar whenever there is some constant such that every side in one triangle is times as long as the corresponding side in the other and the corresponding angles in the two triangles are equal. An important result from geometry tells us that if two triangles are known to have all three of their corresponding angles equal, then it follows that the two triangles are similar, and therefore their corresponding sides must be proportionate to one another.    Consider right triangle given in Figure , and assume that the length of the hypotenuse is for some constant . Let point lie on (the line segment between and ) in such a way that , and let point lie on so that is a right angle, as pictured. In addition, assume that point corresponds to , point to , and point to so that and . Finally, let be the measure of .   Two right triangles and .       Explain why and are similar triangles.    What is the value of the ratio ? What does this tell you about the ratios and ?    What is the value of in terms of ? What is the value of in terms of ?    Use your conclusions in (b) and (c) to express the values of and in terms of and .                 Ratios of sides in right triangles  A right triangle with a hypotenuse of length can be viewed as lying in standard position in the unit circle, with one vertex at the origin and one leg along the positive -axis. If we let the angle formed by the hypotenuse and the horizontal leg be represented by , then the right triangle with hypotenuse has horizontal leg of length and vertical leg of length . If we now consider a similar right triangle with hypotenuse of length , we can view that triangle as a magnification of a triangle with hypotenuse . These observations, combined with our work in Activity , show us that the horizontal legs of the right triangle with hypotenuse have lengths and , as pictured in Figure .   The roles of and in a right triangle.    From the similar triangles in Figure , we can make an important observation about ratios in right triangles. Because the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal, so if we consider the two hypotenuses and the two horizontal legs, we have . If we rearrange Equation by dividing both sides by and multiplying both sides by , we see that . From a geometric perspective, Equation tells us that the ratio of the length of the horizontal leg of a right triangle to the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is always the same (regardless of ) and that the value of that ratio is , where is the angle adjacent to the horizontal leg. In an analogous way, the equation involving the hypotenuses and vertical legs of the similar triangles is , which can be rearranged to . Equation shows that the ratio of the length of the vertical leg of a right triangle to the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle is always the same (regardless of ) and that the value of that ratio is , where is the angle opposite the vertical leg. We summarize these recent observations as follows.   Ratios in right triangles   In a right triangle where one of the non-right angles is , and adj denotes the length of the leg adjacent to , opp the length the side opposite , and hyp the length of the hypotenuse, .       In each of the following scenarios involving a right triangle, determine the exact values of as many of the remaining side lengths and angle measures (in radians) that you can. If there are quantities that you cannot determine, explain why. For every prompt, draw a labeled diagram of the situation.     A right triangle with hypotenuse and one non-right angle of measure .    A right triangle with non-right angle that satisfies .    A right triangle where one of the non-right angles has measure and the hypotenuse has length .    A right triangle with hypotenuse and one leg of length .    A right triangle with legs of length and .    A right triangle where one of the non-right angles has measure and the leg opposite this angle has length .                 Using a ratio involving sine and cosine  In Activity , we found that in many cases where we have a right triangle, knowing two additional pieces of information enables us to find the remaining three unknown quantities in the triangle. At this point in our studies, the following general principles hold.   Missing information in right triangles  In any right triangle,     if we know one of the non-right angles and the length of the hypotenuse, we can find both the remaining non-right angle and the lengths of the two legs;    if we know the length of two sides of the triangle, then we can find the length of the other side;    if we know the measure of one non-right angle, then we can find the measure of the remaining angle.      In scenario (1.), all features of the triangle are not only determined, but we are able to find their values. In (2.), the triangle is uniquely determined by the given information, but as in Activity parts (d) and (e), while we know the values of the sine and cosine of the angles in the triangle, we haven't yet developed a way to determine the measures of those angles. Finally, in scenario (3.), the triangle is not uniquely determined, since any magnified version of the triangle will have the same three angles as the given one, and thus we need more information to determine side length.  We will revisit scenario (2) in our future work. Now, however, we want to consider a situation that is similar to (1), but where it is one leg of the triangle instead of the hypotenuse that is known. We encountered this in Activity part (f): a right triangle where one of the non-right angles is and the leg opposite this angle has length .      Consider a right triangle in which one of the non-right angles is and the leg opposite has length .  Determine (both exactly and approximately) the measures of all of the remaining sides and angles in the triangle.    The given right triangle.       From the fact that , it follows that .

Summary    In a right triangle with hypotenuse , we can view as the length of the leg adjacent to and as the length of the leg opposite , as seen in Figure . This is simply a change in perspective achieved by focusing on the triangle as opposed to the unit circle.    Because a right triangle with hypotenuse of length can be thought of as a scaled version of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length , we can conclude that in a right triangle with hypotenuse of length , the leg adjacent to angle has length , and the leg opposite has length , as seen in Figure . Moreover, in any right triangle with angle , we know that .    In a right triangle, there are five additional characteristics: the measures of the two non-right angles and the lengths of the three sides. In general, if we know one of those two angles and one of the three sides, we can determine all of the remaining pieces.        Refer to the right triangle in the figure.

Why is the graph of the tangent function so different from the graphs of the sine and cosine functions?    What are important applications of the tangent function?       In Activity , we determined the distance between two points and on opposite sides of a river by knowing a length along one shore of the river and the angle formed between a point downstream and the point on the opposite shore, as pictured in Figure . By first using the cosine of the angle, we determined the value of and from there were able to use the sine of the angle to find , the river's width, which turns out to be .   Finding the width of the river.     It turns out that we regularly need to evaluate the ratio of the sine and cosine functions at the same angle, so it is convenient to define a new function to be their ratio.   The tangent function  tangent function   For any real number for which , we define the tangent of , denoted , by .      Through the following questions, we work to understand the special values and overall behavior of the tangent function.     Without using computational device, find the exact value of at the following values: .     Why is not defined? What are three other input values for which is not defined?    Point your browser to http:\/\/gvsu.edu\/s\/0yO ( zero-y-Oh ) to find a Desmos worksheet with data from the tangent function already input, denoted in Desmos by the function . Click on several of the orange points to compare your exact values in (a) with the decimal values given by Desmos . Add one entry to the table: , . At about what coordinates does this point lie? What are the approximate values of and ? Why is the value of so large relative to the other values of in the table?    At the top of the input lists on the left side of the Desmos worksheet, click the circle to highlight the function and thus show its plot along with the data points in orange. Use the plot and your work above to answer the following important questions about the tangent function:   What is the domain of ?    What is the period of ?    What is the range of ?             Two perspectives on the tangent function    An angle in standard position in the unit circle that intercepts an arc from to     A right triangle with legs adjacent and opposite angle .     Because the tangent function is defined in terms of the two fundamental circular functions by the rule , we can use our understanding of the sine and cosine functions to make sense of the tangent function. In particular, we can think of the tangent of an angle from two different perspectives: as an angle in standard position in the unit circle, or as an angle in a right triangle.  From the viewpoint of Figure , as the point corresponding to angle traverses the circle and generates the point , we know and , and therefore the tangent function tracks the ratio of these two quantities, and is given by . From the perspective of any right triangle (not necessarily in the unit circle) with hypotenuse hyp and legs adj and opp that are respectively adjacent and opposite the known angle , as seen in Figure , we know that and . Substituting these expressions for and in the rule for the tangent function, we see that .  We typically use the first perspective of tracking the ratio of the -coordinate to the -coordinate of a point traversing the unit circle in order to think of the overall behavior and graph of the tangent function, and use the second perspective in a right triangle whenever we are working to determine missing values in a triangle.    Properties of the tangent function  Because the tangent function is defined in terms of the sine and cosine functions, its values and behavior are completely determined by those two functions. To begin, we know the value of for every special angle on the unit circle that we identified for the sine and cosine functions. For instance, we know that . Executing similar computations for every familiar special angle on the unit circle, we find the results shown in Table and Table . We also note that anywhere , the value of is undefined. We record such instances in the table by writing u .   Values of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions at special points on the unit circle.                                             u          Additional values of the sine, cosine, and tangent functions at special points on the unit circle.                                         u          Table and Table helps us identify trends in the tangent function. For instance, we observe that the sign of is positive in Quadrant I, negative in Quadrant II, positive in Quadrant III, and negative in Quadrant IV. This holds because the sine and cosine functions have the same sign in the first and third quadrants, and opposite signs in the other two quadrants.  In addition, we observe that as -values in the first quadrant get closer to , gets closer to , while gets closer to (while being always positive). Noting that , we observe that and . Because the ratio of numbers closer and closer to divided by numbers closer and closer to (but positive) increases without bound, this means that increases without bound as approaches from the left side. Once is slightly greater than in Quadrant II, the value of stays close to , but now the value of is negative (and close to zero). For instance, . This makes the value of decrease without bound (negative and getting further away from ) for approaching from the right side, and results in having a vertical asymptote at . The periodicity and sign behaviors of and mean this asymptotic behavior of the tangent function will repeat.  Plotting the data in the table along with the expected asymptotes and connecting the points intuitively, we see the graph of the tangent function in Figure .   A plot of the tangent function together with special points that come from the unit circle.    We see from Table and Table as well as from Figure that the tangent function has period and that the function is increasing on any interval on which it is defined. We summarize our recent work as follows.   Properties of the tangent function  For the function ,   its domain is the set of all real numbers except where is any whole number;    its range is the set of all real numbers;    its period is ;    is increasing on any interval on which the function is defined at every point in the interval.      While the tangent function is an interesting mathematical function for its own sake, its most important applications arise in the setting of right triangles, and for the remainder of this section we will focus on that perspective.    Using the tangent function in right triangles  The tangent function offers us an additional choice when working in right triangles with limited information. In the setting where we have a right triangle with one additional known angle, if we know the length of the hypotenuse, we can use either the sine or cosine of the angle to help us easily find the remaining side lengths. But in the setting where we know only the length of one leg, the tangent function now allows us to determine the value of the remaining leg in a similarly straightforward way, and from there the hypotenuse.    Use the tangent function to determine the width, , of the river in Figure . (Note that here we are revisiting the problem in Activity , which we previously solved without using the tangent function.) What other information can we now easily determine?   A right triangle with one angle and one leg known.      Using the perspective that in a right triangle, in this context we have and thus is the exact width of the river. Using a computational device, we find that .  Once we know the river's width, we can use the Pythagorean theorem or the sine function to determine the distance from to , at which point all parts of the triangle are known.    The tangent function finds a wide range of applications in finding missing information in right triangles where information about one or more legs of the triangle is known.    The top of a foot tower is to be anchored by four cables that each make an angle of with the ground. How long do the cables have to be and how far from the base of the tower must they be anchored?               Supertall See, for instance, this article high rises have changed the Manhattan skyline. These skyscrapers are known for their small footprint in proportion to their height, with their ratio of width to height at most , and some as extreme as . Suppose that a relatively short supertall has been built to a height of feet, as pictured in Figure , and that a second supertall is built nearby. Given the two angles that are computed from the new building, how tall, , is the new building, and how far apart, , are the two towers?   Two supertall skyscrapers.                 Surveyors are trying to determine the height of a hill relative to sea level. First, they choose a point to take an initial measurement with a sextant that shows the angle of elevation from the ground to the peak of the hill is . Next, they move feet closer to the hill, staying at the same elevation relative to sea level, and find that the angle of elevation has increased to , as pictured in Figure . We let represent the height of the hill relative to the two measurements, and represent the distance from the second measurement location to the center of the hill that lies directly under the peak.   The surveyors' initial measurements.       Using the right triangle with the angle, find an equation that relates and .    Using the right triangle with the angle, find a second equation that relates and .    Our work in (a) and (b) results in a system of two equations in the two unknowns and . Solve each of the two equations for and then substitute appropriately in order to find a single equation in the variable .    Solve the equation from (c) to find the exact value of and determine an approximate value accurate to decimal places.    Use your preceding work to solve for exactly, plus determine an estimate accurate to decimal places.    If the surveyors' initial measurements were taken from an elevation of feet above sea level, how high above sea level is the peak of the hill?                 Summary     The tangent function is defined defined to be the ratio of the sine and cosine functions according to the rule for all values of for which .    The graph of the tangent function differs substantially from the graphs of the sine and cosine functions, primarily because near values where , the ratio of increases or decreases without bound, producing vertical asymptotes. In addition, while the period of the sine and cosine functions is , the period of the tangent function is due to how the sine and cosine functions repeat the same values (with different signs) as a point traverses the unit circle.    The tangent function finds some of its most important applications in the setting of right triangles where one leg of the triangle is known and one of the non-right angles is known. Computing the tangent of the known angle, say , and using the fact that we can then find the missing leg's length in terms of the other and the tangent of the angle.

For the restricted cosine, sine, and tangent functions, how do we define the corresponding arccosine, arcsine, and arctangent functions?    What are the key properties of the arccosine, arcsine, and arctangent functions?      In our prior work with inverse functions, we have seen several important principles, including   A function has an inverse function if and only if there exists a function that undoes the work of . Such a function has the properties that for each in the domain of , and for each in the range of . We call the inverse of , and write .    A function has an inverse function if and only if the graph of passes the .    When has an inverse, we know that writing and say the exact same thing, but from two different perspectives.     The trigonometric functions , , and are periodic, so each fails the horizontal line test, and thus these functions on their full domains do not have inverse functions. At the same time, it is reasonable to think about changing perspective and viewing angles as outputs in certain restricted settings. For instance, we may want to say both depending on the context in which we are considering the relationship between the angle and side length.  It's also important to understand why the issue of finding an angle in terms of a known value of a trigonometric function is important. Suppose we know the following information about a right triangle: one leg has length , and the hypotenuse has length . If we let be the angle opposite the side of length , it follows that . We naturally want to use the inverse of the sine function to solve the most recent equation for . But the sine function does not have an inverse function, so how can we address this situation?  While the original trigonometric functions , , and do not have inverse functions, it turns out that we can consider restricted versions of them that do have corresponding inverse functions. We thus investigate how we can think differently about the trigonometric functions so that we can discuss inverses in a meaningful way.    Consider the plot of the standard cosine function in Figure along with the emphasized portion of the graph on .   The cosine function on with the portion on emphasized.    Let be the function whose domain is and whose outputs are determined by the rule . Note well : is defined in terms of the cosine function, but because it has a different domain, it is not the cosine function.     What is the domain of ?    What is the range of ?    Does pass the horizontal line test? Why or why not?    Explain why has an inverse function, , and state the domain and range of .    We know that . What is the exact value of ? How about the exact value of ?    Determine the exact values of , , , and . Use proper notation to label your results.         The arccosine function  For the cosine function restricted to the domain that we considered in Preview Activity , the function is strictly decreasing on its domain and thus passes the Horizontal Line Test. Therefore, this restricted version of the cosine function has an inverse function; we will call this inverse function the arccosine function.   inverse trigonometric functions arccosine   Let be defined on the domain , and observe . For any real number that satisfies , the arccosine of , denoted is the angle satisfying such that .    Note particularly that the output of the arccosine function is an angle. In addition, recall that in the context of the unit circle, an angle measured in radians and the corresponding arc length along the unit circle are numerically equal. This is why we use the arc in arccosine : given a value , the arccosine function produces the corresponding arc (measured counterclockwise from ) such that the cosine of that arc is .  We recall that for any function with an inverse function, the inverse function reverses the process of the original function. We know that can be read as saying is the cosine of the angle . Changing perspective and writing the equivalent statement , we read this statement as is the angle whose cosine is . Just as and say the same thing for a function and its inverse in general, say the same thing for any angle that satisfies . We also use the equivalent notation interchangeably with . We read as is the angle whose cosine is or is the inverse cosine of . Key properties of the arccosine function can be summarized as follows.   Properties of the arccosine function      The restricted cosine function, , is defined on the domain with range . This function has an inverse function that we call the arccosine function, denoted .    The domain of is with range .    The arccosine function is always decreasing on its domain.    At right, a plot of the restricted cosine function (in light blue) and its corresponding inverse, the arccosine function (in dark blue).        Just as the natural logarithm function allowed us to rewrite exponential equations in an equivalent way (for instance, and say the exact same thing), the arccosine function allows us to do likewise for certain angles and cosine outputs. For instance, saying is the same as writing , which reads is the angle whose cosine is . Indeed, these relationships are reflected in the plot above, where we see that any point that lies on the graph of corresponds to the point that lies on the graph of .    Use the special points on the unit circle (see, for instance, Figure ) to determine the exact values of each of the following numerical expressions.

The arcsine function  We can develop an inverse function for a restricted version of the sine function in a similar way. As with the cosine function, we need to choose an interval on which the sine function is always increasing or always decreasing in order to have the function pass the horizontal line test. The standard choice is the domain on which is increasing and attains all of the values in the range of the sine function. Thus, we consider so that and hence define the corresponding arcsine function.   inverse trigonometric functions arcsine   Let be defined on the domain , and observe . For any real number that satisfies , the arcsine of , denoted is the angle satisfying such that .      The goal of this activity is to understand key properties of the arcsine function in a way similar to our discussion of the arccosine function in Subsection .     Using Definition , what are the domain and range of the arcsine function?    Determine the following values exactly: , , , , and .    On the axes provided in Figure , sketch a careful plot of the restricted sine function on the interval along with its corresponding inverse, the arcsine function.

For any real number , the arctangent of , denoted is the angle satisfying such that .      The goal of this activity is to understand key properties of the arctangent function.     Using Definition , what are the domain and range of the arctangent function?    Determine the following values exactly: , , , and .    A plot of the restricted tangent function on the interval is provided in Figure . Sketch its corresponding inverse function, the arctangent function, on the same axes. Label at least three points on each curve so that each point on the tangent graph corresponds to a point on the arctangent graph. In addition, sketch the line to demonstrate how the graphs are reflections of one another across this line.   Axes for plotting the restricted tangent function and its inverse, the arctangent function.      Complete the following sentence: as increases without bound,  .                 Summary     Any function that fails the Horizontal Line Test cannot have an inverse function. However, for a periodic function that fails the horizontal line test, if we restrict the domain of the function to an interval with no repeated outputs, we then determine a related function that does, in fact, have an inverse function. By choosing such an interval carefully, it is possible for us to develop the inverse functions of the restricted cosine, sine, and tangent functions.    We choose to define the restricted cosine, sine, and tangent functions on the respective domains , , and . On each such interval, the restricted function is strictly decreasing (cosine) or strictly increasing (sine and tangent), and thus has an inverse function. The restricted sine and cosine functions each have range , while the restricted tangent's range is the set of all real numbers. We thus define the inverse function of each as follows:     For any such that , the arccosine of (denoted ) is the angle in the interval such that . That is, is the angle whose cosine is .    For any such that , the arcsine of (denoted ) is the angle in the interval such that . That is, is the angle whose sine is .    For any real number , the arctangent of (denoted ) is the angle in the interval such that . That is, is the angle whose tangent is .       To discuss the properties of the three inverse trigonometric functions, we plot them on the same axes as their corresponding restricted trigonometric functions. When we do so, we use as the input variable for both functions simultaneously so that we can plot them on the same coordinate axes.  The domain of is with corresponding range , and the arccosine function is always decreasing. These facts correspond to the domain and range of the restricted cosine function and the fact that the restricted cosine function is decreasing on .

  "title": "Finding Angles",
  "body": " Finding Angles     How can we use inverse trigonometric functions to determine missing angles in right triangles?    What situations require us to use technology to evaluate inverse trigonometric functions?      In our earlier work in Section and Section , we observed that in any right triangle, if we know the measure of one additional angle and the length of one additional side, we can determine all of the other parts of the triangle. With the inverse trigonometric functions that we developed in Section , we are now also able to determine the missing angles in any right triangle where we know the lengths of two sides.  While the original trigonometric functions take a particular angle as input and provide an output that can be viewed as the ratio of two sides of a right triangle, the inverse trigonometric functions take an input that can be viewed as a ratio of two sides of a right triangle and produce the corresponding angle as output. Indeed, it's imperative to remember that statements such as say the exact same thing from two different perspectives, and that we read as the angle whose cosine is .    Consider a right triangle that has one leg of length and another leg of length . Let be the angle that lies opposite the shorter leg.     Sketch a labeled picture of the triangle.    What is the exact length of the triangle's hypotenuse?    What is the exact value of ?    Rewrite your equation from (c) using the arcsine function in the form , where and are numerical values.    What special angle from the unit circle is ?         Evaluating inverse trigonometric functions  Like the trigonometric functions themselves, there are a handful of important values of the inverse trigonometric functions that we can determine exactly without the aid of a computer. For instance, we know from the unit circle ( Figure ) that , , and . In these evaluations, we have to be careful to remember that the range of the arccosine function is , while the range of the arcsine function is and the range of the arctangent function is , in order to ensure that we choose the appropriate angle that results from the inverse trigonometric function.  In addition, there are many other values at which we may wish to know the angle that results from an inverse trigonometric function. To determine such values, we use a computational device (such as Desmos ) in order to evaluate the function.     Consider the right triangle pictured in Figure and assume we know that the vertical leg has length and the hypotenuse has length . Let be the angle opposite the known leg. Determine exact and approximate values for all of the remaining parts of the triangle.   A right triangle with one known leg and known hypotenuse.       Because we know the hypotenuse and the side opposite , we observe that . Rewriting this statement using inverse function notation, we have equivalently that , which is the exact value of . Since this is not one of the known special angles on the unit circle, we can find a numerical estimate of using a computational device. Entering arcsin(1\/3) in Desmos , we find that radians. Note well: whatever device we use, we need to be careful to use degree or radian mode as dictated by the problem we are solving. We will always work in radians unless stated otherwise.  We can now find the remaining leg's length and the remaining angle's measure. If we let represent the length of the horizontal leg, by the Pythagorean Theorem we know that , and thus so . Calling the remaining angle , since , it follows that .      For each of the following different scenarios, draw a picture of the situation and use inverse trigonometric functions appropriately to determine the missing information both exactly and approximately.     Consider a right triangle with legs of length and . What are the measures (in radians) of the non-right angles and what is the length of the hypotenuse?    Consider an angle in standard position (vertex at the origin, one side on the positive -axis) for which we know and lies in quadrant III. What is the measure of in radians? In addition, what is the value of ?    Consider an angle in standard position for which we know and lies in quadrant II. What is the measure of in radians? In addition, what is the value of ?                 Finding angles in applied contexts  Now that we have developed the (restricted) sine, cosine, and tangent functions and their respective inverses, in any setting in which we have a right triangle together with one side length and any one additional piece of information (another side length or a non-right angle measurement), we can determine all of the remaining pieces of the triangle. In the activities that follow, we explore these possibilities in a variety of different applied contexts.    A roof is being built with a 7-12 pitch. This means that the roof rises inches vertically for every inches of horizontal span; in other words, the slope of the roof is . What is the exact measure (in degrees) of the angle the roof makes with the horizontal? What is the approximate measure? What are the exact and approximate measures of the angle at the peak of the roof (made by the front and back portions of the roof that meet to form the ridge)?              On a baseball diamond (which is a square with -foot sides), the third baseman fields the ball right on the line from third base to home plate and feet away from third base (towards home plate). When he throws the ball to first base, what angle (in degrees) does the line the ball travels make with the first base line? What angle does it make with the third base line? Draw a well-labeled diagram to support your thinking.  What angles arise if he throws the ball to second base instead?              A camera is tracking the launch of a SpaceX rocket. The camera is located ' from the rocket's launching pad, and the camera angle changes in order to keep the rocket in focus. At what angle (in radians) is the camera tilted when the rocket is ' off the ground? Answer both exactly and approximately.  Now, rather than considering the rocket at a fixed height of ', let its height vary and call the rocket's height . Determine the camera's angle, as a function of , and compute the average rate of change of on the intervals , , and . What do you observe about how the camera angle is changing?              Summary       Anytime we know two side lengths in a right triangle, we can use one of the inverse trigonometric functions to determine the measure of one of the non-right angles. For instance, if we know the values of and in Figure , then since , it follows that .  If we instead know the hypotenuse and one of the two legs, we can use either the arcsine or arccosine function accordingly.    Finding an angle from knowing the legs in a right triangle.       For situations other than angles or ratios that involve the special points on the unit circle, technology is required in order to evaluate inverse trignometric functions. For instance, from the unit circle we know that (exactly), but if we want to know , we have to estimate this value using a computational device such as Desmos . We note that is the exact value of the angle whose cosine is .         If and , approximate the following to four decimal places.  (a) = (Round to four decimal places.)  (b) = (Round to four decimal places.)             SOLUTION a) We begin by using the Pythagorean Identity to find . Since , we have   . Since , is negative, so . b)         Suppose and the angle is in the first quadrant. Write algebraic expressions for and in terms of .  (a) =  (b) =             SOLUTION (a) Using the Pythagorean Identity , we can solve for : Since the angle is in the first quadrant, , so (b)         Using inverse trigonometric functions, find a solution to the equation in the interval . Then, use a graph to find all other solutions to this equation in this interval. Enter your answers as a comma separated list.          SOLUTION By sketching a graph, we see that there are four solutions: The first solution is given by , which is equivalent to the length labeled in the figure above. Next, note that, by the symmetry of the graph of the cosine function, we can obtain a second solution by subtracting the length from . Therefore, a second solution to the equation is given by (labeled ). Similarly, our final two solutions are given by and which are labeled and respectively in the figure above.        At an airshow, a pilot is flying low over a runway while maintaining a constant altitude of feet and a constant speed. On a straight path over the runway, the pilot observes on her laser range-finder that the distance from the plane to a fixed building adjacent to the runway is feet. Five seconds later, she observes that distance to the same building is now feet.     What is the angle of depression from the plane to the building when the plane is feet away from the building?

  "body": " Other Trigonometric Functions and Identities     What are the other trigonometric functions and how are they related to the cosine, sine, and tangent functions?    How do the graphs of the secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions behave and how do these graphs compare to the cosine, sine, and tangent functions' graphs?    What is a trigonometric identity and why are identities important?      The sine and cosine functions, originally defined in the context of a point traversing the unit circle, are also central in right triangle trigonometry. They enable us to find missing information in right triangles in a straightforward way when we know one of the non-right angles and one of the three sides of the triangle, or two of the sides where one is the hypotenuse. In addition, we defined the tangent function in terms of the sine and cosine functions, and the tangent function offers additional options for finding missing information in right triangles. We've also seen how the inverses of the restricted sine, cosine, and tangent functions enable us to find missing angles in a wide variety of settings involving right triangles.  One of the powerful aspects of trigonometry is that the subject offers us the opportunity to view the same idea from many different perspectives. As one example, we have observed that the functions and are actually the same function; as another, for values in the domain , we know that writing is the same as writing . Which perspective we choose to take often depends on context and given information.  While almost every question involving trigonometry can be answered using the sine, cosine, and tangent functions, sometimes it is convenient to use three related functions that are connected to the other three possible arrangements of ratios of sides in right triangles.   secant function  cosecant function  cotangent function  The secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions      For any real number for which , we define the secant of , denoted , by the rule .    For any real number for which , we define the cosecant of , denoted , by the rule .    For any real number for which , we define the cotangent of , denoted , by the rule .       Note particularly that like the tangent function, the secant, cosecant, and cotangent are also defined completely in terms of the sine and cosine functions. In the context of a right triangle with an angle , we know how to think of , , and as ratios of sides of the triangle. We can now do likewise with the other trigonometric functions:       A right triangle with angle .     With these three additional trigonometric functions, we now have expressions that address all six possible combinations of two sides of a right triangle in a ratio.    Consider a right triangle with hypotenuse of length and one leg of length . Let be the angle opposite the side of length . Find the exact length of the other leg and then determine the value of each of the six trigonometric functions evaluated at . In addition, what are the exact and approximate measures of the two non-right angles in the triangle?      Ratios in right triangles  Because the sine and cosine functions are used to define each of the other four trigonometric functions, it follows that we can translate information known about the other functions back to information about the sine and cosine functions. For example, if we know that in a certain triangle , it follows that . From there we can reason in the usual way to determine missing information in the given triangle.  It's also often possible to view given information in the context of the unit circle. With the earlier given information that , it's natural to view as being the angle in a right triangle that lies opposite a leg of length with the hypotenuse being , since . The Pythagorean Theorem then tells us the leg adjacent to has length , as seen in in Figure .   A - - right triangle.    But we could also view as , and thus think of the right triangle has having hypotenuse and vertical leg . This triangle is similar to the originally considered - - right triangle, but can be viewed as lying within the unit circle. The perspective of the unit circle is particularly valuable when ratios such as , , and arise in right triangles.    Suppose that is an angle in standard position with its terminal side in quadrant II and you know that . Without using a computational device in any way, determine the exact values of the other five trigonometric functions evaluated at .              Properties of the secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions  Like the tangent function, the secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions are defined in terms of the sine and cosine functions, so we can determine the exact values of these functions at each of the special points on the unit circle. In addition, we can use our understanding of the unit circle and the properties of the sine and cosine functions to determine key properties of these other trigonometric functions. We begin by investigating the secant function.  Using the fact that , we note that anywhere , the value of is undefined. We denote such instances in the following table by u . At all other points, the value of the secant function is simply the reciprocal of the cosine function's value. Since for all , it follows that for all (for which the secant's value is defined).   Values of the cosine and secant functions at special points on the unit circle (Quadrants I and II).                                 u          Values of the cosine and secant functions at special points on the unit circle (Quadrants III and IV).                              u          Table and Table help us identify trends in the secant function. The sign of matches the sign of and thus is positive in Quadrant I, negative in Quadrant II, negative in Quadrant III, and positive in Quadrant IV.  In addition, we observe that as -values in the first quadrant get closer to , gets closer to (while being always positive). Since the numerator of the secant function is always , having its denominator approach (while the denominator remains positive) means that increases without bound as approaches from the left side. Once is slightly greater than in Quadrant II, the value of is negative (and close to zero). This makes the value of decrease without bound (negative and getting further away from ) for approaching from the right side. We therefore see that has a vertical asymptote at ; the periodicity and sign behavior of mean this asymptotic behavior of the secant function will repeat.  Plotting the data in the table along with the expected asymptotes and connecting the points intuitively, we see the graph of the secant function in Figure .   A plot of the secant function with special points that come from the unit circle, plus the cosine function (dotted, in light blue).    We see from both the table and the graph that the secant function has period . We summarize our recent work as follows.   Properties of the secant function  For the function ,   its domain is the set of all real numbers except where is any whole number;    its range is the set of all real numbers such that ;    its period is .

On intervals where the function is defined at every point in the interval, is always increasing, always decreasing, or neither?    What is the period of the cotangent function?    How would you describe the relationship between the graphs of the tangent and cotangent functions?                 A few important identities  An identity is an equation that is true for all possible values of for which the involved quantities are defined. An example of a non-trigonometric identity is , since this equation is true for every value of , and the left and right sides of the equation are simply two different-looking but entirely equivalent expressions.  Trigonometric identities are simply identities that involve trigonometric functions. While there are a large number of such identities one can study, we choose to focus on those that turn out to be most useful in the study of calculus. The most important trigonometric identity is the fundamental trigonometric identity, which is a trigonometric restatement of the Pythagorean Theorem.   fundamental trigonometric identity  The fundamental trigonometric identity  For any real number , .   Identities are important because they enable us to view the same idea from multiple perspectives. For example, the fundamental trigonometric identity allows us to think of as simply , or alternatively, to view as the same quantity as .  There are two related Pythagorean identities that involve the tangent, secant, cotangent, and cosecant functions, which we can derive from the fundamental trigonometric identity by dividing both sides by either or . If we divide both sides of Equation by (and assume that ), we see that , or equivalently, . A similar argument dividing by (while assuming ) shows that . These identities prove useful in calculus when we develop the formulas for the derivatives of the tangent and cotangent functions.  In calculus, it is also beneficial to know a couple of other standard identities for sums of angles or double angles. sum of two angles identity  double angle identity We simply state these identities without justification. For more information about them, see Section 10.4 in College Trigonometry , by Stitz and Zeager More information on Stitz and Zeager's free texts can be found at . .     For all real numbers and , .    For all real numbers and , .    For any real number , .    For any real number , .       In this activity, we investigate how a sum of two angles identity for the sine function helps us gain a different perspective on the average rate of change of the sine function.  Recall that for any function on an interval , its average rate of change is .     Let . Use the definition of to write an expression for the average rate of change of the sine function on the interval .    Apply the sum of two angles identity for the sine function, , to the expression .    Explain why your work in (a) and (b) together with some algebra shows that .    In calculus, we move from average rate of change to instantaneous rate of change by letting approach in the expression for average rate of change. Using a computational device in radian mode, investigate the behavior of as gets close to . What happens? Similarly, how does behave for small values of ? What does this tell us about for the sine function as approaches ?                 Summary     The secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions are respectively defined as the reciprocals of the cosine, sine, and tangent functions. That is, .    The graph of the cotangent function is similar to the graph of the tangent function, except that it is decreasing on every interval on which it is defined and has vertical asymptotes wherever and is zero wherever has a vertical asymptote.  The graphs of the secant and cosecant functions are different from the cosine and sine functions' graphs in several ways, including that their range is the set of all real numbers such that and they have vertical asymptotes wherever the cosine and sine function, respectively, are zero.    A trigonometric identity is an equation involving trigonometric functions that is true for every value of the variable for which the trigonometric functions are defined. For instance, for every real number except . Identities offer us alternate perspectives on the same function. For instance, the function is the same (at all points where is defined) as the function whose value is always .

What are some important limits and trends involving that we can observe for familiar functions such as , , , and ?    What is a power function and how does the value of the power determine the function's overall behavior?      In Section , we compared the behavior of the exponential functions and , and observed in Figure that as increases without bound, also increases without bound, while approaches (while having its value be always positive). We also introduced shorthand notation for describing these phenomena, writing and . It's important to remember that infinity is not itself a number. We use the symbol to represent a quantity that gets larger and larger with no bound on its growth.  We also know that the concept of infinity plays a key role in understanding the graphical behavior of functions. For instance, we've seen that for a function such as , as , since as increases without bound.

If we can make the value of as close to as we want by letting increase without bound, we write and say that the limit of as increases without bound is .  If the value of increases without bound as increases without bound, we instead write .  Finally, if doesn't increase without bound, doesn't decrease without bound, and doesn't approach a single value as , we say that does not have a limit as .    We use limit notation in related, natural ways to express patterns we see in function behavior. For instance, we write when we let decrease without bound, and if decreases without bound. We can also think about an input value approaching a value at which the function is not defined. As one example, we write because the natural logarithm function decreases without bound as input values get closer and closer to (while always being positive), as seen in Figure .  In the situation where , this tells us that has a horizontal asymptote horizontal asymptote at since the function's value approaches this fixed number as increases without bound. Similarly, if we can say that , this shows that has a vertical asymptote vertical asymptote at since the function's value increases without bound as inputs approach the fixed number .  For now, we are going to focus on the long-range behavior of certain basic, familiar functions and work to understand how they behave as the input increases or decreases without bound. Above we've used the input variable in most of our previous work; going forward, we'll regularly use as well.

Power functions  To date, we have worked with several families of functions: linear functions of form , quadratic functions in standard form, , the sinusoidal (trigonometric) functions or , transformed exponential functions such as , and transformed logarithmic functions of form . For trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, it was essential that we first understood the behavior of the basic parent functions , , , and . In order to build on our prior work with linear and quadratic functions, we now consider basic functions such as , , and additional powers of .   power function   A function of the form where is any real number is called a power function .

In the situation where the power is a negative integer (i.e., a negative whole number), power functions behave very differently. This is because of the property of exponents that states so for a power function such as , we can equivalently consider . Note well that for these functions, their domain is the set of all real numbers except .

Summary    The notation means that we can make the value of as close to as we'd like by letting be sufficiently large. This indicates that the value of eventually stops changing much and tends to a single value, and thus is a horizontal asymptote of the function .  Similarly, the notation means that we can make the value of as large as we'd like by letting be sufficiently close, but not equal, to .

We summarize some key behavior of familiar basic functions with limits as increases without bound in Table .   Some familiar functions and their limits as or .                     NA Because the domain of the natural logarithm function is only positive real numbers, it doesn't make sense to even consider this limit.                                   no limit Because the sine function neither increases without bound nor approaches a single value, but rather keeps oscillating through every value between and repeatedly, the sine function does not have a limit as .  no limit     Additionally, Table summarizes some key familiar function behavior where the function's output increases or decreases without bound as approaches a fixed number not in the function's domain.

Informally, all power functions of form where is a positive even number are U-shaped , while all power functions of form where is a positive odd number are chair-shaped .

What is a sign chart and how does it help us understand a polynomial function's behavior?    How do zeros of multiplicity other than impact the graph of a polynomial function?      We know that linear functions are the simplest of all functions we can consider: their graphs have the simplest shape, their average rate of change is always constant (regardless of the interval chosen), and their formula is elementary. Moreover, computing the value of a linear function only requires multiplication and addition.  If we think of a linear function as having formula , and the next-simplest functions, quadratic functions, as having form , we can see immediate parallels between their respective forms and realize that it's natural to consider slightly more complicated functions by adding additional power functions.  Indeed, if we instead view linear functions as having form (for some constants and ) and quadratic functions as having form (for some constants , , and ), then it's natural to think about more general functions of this same form, but with additional power functions included.   polynomial function   Given real numbers where , we say that the function is a polynomial of degree . polynomial degree In addition, we say that the values of are the coefficients of the polynomial and the individual power functions are the terms of the polynomial. polynomial coefficients  polynomial terms Any value of for which is called a zero of the polynomial. polynomial zero       The polyomial function has degree , its constant term is , and its linear term is .    Since a polynomial is simply a sum of constant multiples of various power functions with positive integer powers, we often refer to those individual terms by referring to their individual degrees: the linear term, the quadratic term, and so on. In addition, since the domain of any power function of the form where is a positive whole number is the set of all real numbers, it's also true the the domain of any polynomial function is the set of all real numbers.    Point your browser to the Desmos worksheet at http:\/\/gvsu.edu\/s\/0zy . There you'll find a degree polynomial of the form , where are set up as sliders. In the questions that follow, you'll experiment with different values of to investigate different possible behaviors in a degree polynomial. Note that we require in order to ensure is a degree polynomial.     What is the largest number of distinct points at which can cross the -axis?  Recall from Definition what we mean by a zero of the polynomial. Give examples of values for that lead to that largest number of zeros for .    What other numbers of zeros are possible for ? Said differently, can you get each possible number of fewer zeros than the largest number that you found in (a)? Why or why not?    We say that a function has a turning point  turning point if the function changes from decreasing to increasing or increasing to decreasing at the point. For example, any quadratic function has a turning point at its vertex.  What is the largest number of turning points that (the function in the Desmos worksheet) can have? Experiment with the sliders, and give examples of values for that lead to that largest number of turning points for .    What other numbers of turning points are possible for ? Can it have no turning points? Just one? Exactly two? Experiment and explain.    What long-range behavior is possible for ? Said differently, what are the possible results for and ?    What happens when we plot in Desmos and compare and ? How do they look when we zoom out? (Experiment with different values of each of the sliders, too.)         Key results about polynomial functions  Our observations in Preview Activity generalize to polynomials of any degree. In particular, it is possible to prove the following general conclusions regarding the number of zeros, the long-range behavior, and the number of turning points for any polynomial of degree .   The number of real zeros of a polynomial  For any degree polynomial , has at most real zeros. We can actually say even more: if we allow the zeros to be complex numbers, then every degree polynomial has exactly  zeros, provided we count zeros according to their multiplicity. For example, the polynomial has a zero of multiplicity two at .    We know that each of the power functions , , , grow without bound as . Intuitively, we sense that grows faster than (and likewise for any comparison of a higher power to a lower one). This means that for large values of , the most important term in any polynomial is its highest order term, as we saw in Preview Activity when we compared and .   polynomial long-range behavior  The long-range behavior of a polynomial  For any degree polynomial , its long-range behavior is the same as its highest-order term . Thus, any polynomial of even degree appears U-shaped ( or , like or ) when we zoom way out, and any polynomial of odd degree appears chair-shaped (like or ) when we zoom way out.   In Figure , we see how the degree polynomial pictured there (and in Figure as well) appears to look like as we zoom out.    Plot of a degree polynomial function .     Plot of the same degree polynomial function , but zoomed out.     Finally, a key idea from calculus justifies the fact that the maximum number of turning points of a degree polynomial is , as we conjectured in the degree case in Preview Activity . Moreover, the only possible numbers of turning points must have the same parity as ; that is, if is even, then the number of turning points must be even, and if instead is odd, the number of turning points must also be odd. For instance, for the degree polynomial in Figure , we know that it is chair-shaped, with one end up and one end down. There could be zero turning points and the function could always decrease. But if there is at least one, then there must be a second, since if there were only one the function would decrease and then increase without turning back, which would force the graph to appear U-shaped.   polynomial number of turning points  The turning points of a polynomial  For any degree polynomial , if is even, its number of turning points is exactly one of , , , , and if is odd, its number of turning points is exactly one of , , , .     By experimenting with coefficients in Desmos , find a formula for a polynomial function that has the stated properties, or explain why no such polynomial exists.

Using zeros and signs to understand polynomial behavior  Just like a quadratic function can be written in different forms (standard: , vertex: , and factored: ), it's possible to write a polynomial function in different forms and to gain information about its behavior from those different forms. In particular, if we know all of the zeros of a polynomial function, we can write its formula in factored form, which gives us a deeper understanding of its graph.  The Zero Product Property Zero Product Property states that if two or more numbers are multiplied together and the result is , then at least one of the numbers must be . We use the Zero Product Property regularly with polynomial functions. If we can determine all zeros of a degree polynomial, and we call those zeros , , , , we can write . Moreover, if we are given a polynomial in this factored form, we can quickly determine its zeros. For instance, if , we know that the only way is if at least one of the factors , , , or equals , which implies that , , , or . Hence, from the factored form of a polynomial, it is straightforward to identify the polynomial's zeros, the -values at which its graph crosses the -axis. We can also use the factored form of a polynomial to develop what we call a sign chart , which we demonstrate in Example . sign chart     Consider the polynomial function . Suppose we know that and that . Fully describe the graph of without the aid of a graphing utility.    Since , we immediately know that is a degree polynomial with real zeros: . We are given that and in addition that . If we expand the factored form of , it has form , and since we know that when we zoom out, behaves like , we know that with it follows and .  Since is degree and we know it has zeros at we know there are no other locations where . Thus, on any interval between two zeros (or to the left of the least or the right of the greatest), the polynomial cannot change sign. We now investigate, interval by interval, the sign of the function.  When , it follows that . In addition, since , when , lies to the left of , , and , which also makes and negative. Moreover, we know that the constant . Hence, on the interval , all four terms in are negative, which we indicate by writing in that location on the sign chart pictured in Figure .  In addition, since there are an even number of negative terms in the product, the overall product's sign is positive, which we indicate by the single beneath , and by writing POS below the coordinate axis.   A sign chart for the polynomial function .    We now proceed to the other intervals created by the zeros. On , the term has become positive, since . But both and are negative, as is the constant , and thus we write for this interval, which has overall sign , as noted in the figure. Similar reasoning completes the diagram.  From all of the information we have deduced about , we conclude that regardless of the locations of and , the graph of must look like the curve shown in Figure .   The graph of the polynomial function .        Consider the polynomial function given by .     What is the degree of ? How can you tell without fully expanding the factored form of the function?    What can you say about the sign of the factor ?    What are the zeros of the polynomial ?    Construct a sign chart for by using the zeros you identified in (c) and then analyzing the sign of each factor of .    Without using a graphing utility, construct an approximate graph of that has the zeros of carefully labeled on the -axis.    Use a graphing utility to check your earlier work. What is challenging or misleading when using technology to graph ?                 Multiplicity of polynomial zeros  In Activity , we found that one of the zeros of the polynomial leads to different behavior of the function near that zero than we've seen in other situations. We now consider the more general situation where a polynomial has a repeated factor of the form . When is a factor of a polynomial , we say that has a zero of multiplicity at . polynomial zero of multiplicity   To see the impact of repeated factors, we examine a collection of degree polynomials that each have real zeros. We start with the simplest of all, the function , whose zeros are . Because the factor is repeated times, the zero has multiplicity .  Next we consider the degree polynomial , which has a zero of multiplicity at and a zero of multiplicity at .   A plot of with zero of multiplicity and of multiplicity .    Observe that in Figure , the up-close plot near the zero of multiplicity , the polynomial function looks similar to the basic cubic polynomial . In addition, in Figure , we observe that if we zoom in even futher on the zero of multiplicity , the function looks roughly linear, like a degree polynomial. This type of behavior near repeated zeros turns out to hold in other cases as well.    A plot of zoomed in on the zero of multiplicity .     A plot of zoomed in on the zero of multiplicity .     If we next let , we see that has two distinct real zeros, each of multiplicity . The graph of in Figure shows that behaves similar to a basic quadratic function near each of those zeros and thus shows U-shaped behavior nearby. If instead we let , we see approximately linear behavior near and (the zeros of multiplicity ), and quadratic (U-shaped) behavior near (the zero of multiplicity ), as seen in Figure .    Plot of with zeros and of multiplicity .     Plot of with zeros of multiplicity and and of multiplicity .     Finally, if we consider , which has distinct real zeros each of multiplicity , we observe in Figure that zooming in on each zero individually, the function demonstrates approximately linear behavior as it passes through the -axis.   Plot of with distinct zeros of multiplicity .    Our observations with polynomials of degree in the various figures above generalize to polynomials of any degree.   polynomial multiple zeros  Polynomial zeros of multiplicity  If is a factor of a polynomial , then is a zero of of multiplicity , and near the graph of looks like either or does near . That is, the shape of the graph near the zero is determined by the multiplicity of the zero.     For each of the following prompts, try to determine a formula for a polynomial that satisfies the given criteria. If no such polynomial exists, explain why.     A polynomial of degree whose zeros are (multiplicity ), (multiplicity ), (multiplicity ), and (multiplicity ), and satisfies . What can you say about the values of and ?    A polynomial of degree that satisfies and has the graph shown in Figure . Assume that all of the zeros of are shown in the figure.    A polynomial of degree with distinct real zeros (possibly of different multiplicities) such that has the sign chart in Figure and satisfies .    A polynomial .     A sign chart for the polynomial .       A polynomial of degree with distinct real zeros (possibly of different multiplicities) such that satisfies the sign chart in Figure and satisfies .    A polynomial of degree that satisfies and has the graph shown in Figure . Assume that all of the zeros of are shown in the figure.                 Summary     From a polynomial function's algebraic structure, we can deduce several key traits of the function.     If the function is in standard form, say , we know that its degree is and that when we zoom out, looks like and thus has the same long-range behavior as . Thus, is chair-shaped if is odd and U-shaped if is even. Whether is or depends on the sign of .    If the function is in factored form, say (where the 's are possibly not distinct and possibly complex), we can quickly determine both the degree of the polynomial ( ) and the locations of its zeros, as well as their multiplicities.       A sign chart is a visual way to identify all of the locations where a function is zero along with the sign of the function on the various intervals the zeros create. A sign chart gives us an overall sense of the graph of the function, but without concerning ourselves with any specific values of the function besides the zeros. For a sample sign chart, see Figure .    When a polynomial has a repeated factor such as , we say that is a zero of multiplicity . At the point where will cross the -axis, up close it will look like a cubic polynomial and thus be chair-shaped. In general, if is a factor of a polynomial so that is a zero of multiplicity , the polynomial will behave near like the polynomial behaves near .         Are the functions below polynomials?

  "title": "Modeling with polynomial functions",
  "body": " Modeling with polynomial functions     Why do polynomials arise naturally in the study of problems involving the volume and surface area of three-dimensional containers such as boxes and cylinders?    How can polynomial functions be used to approximate non-polynomial curves and functions?      Polynomial functions are the simplest of all functions in mathematics in part because they only involve multiplication and addition. In any applied setting where we can formulate key ideas using only those arithmetic operations, it's natural that polynomial functions model the corresponding phenomena. For example, in Activity , we saw that for a spherical tank of radius m filling with water, the volume of water in the tank at a given instant, , is a function of the depth, , of the water in the tank at the same moment according to the formula . The function is a polynomial of degree with a repeated zero at and an additional zero at . Because the tank has a radius of , its total height is , and thus the model is only valid on the domain . This polynomial function tells us how the volume of water in the tank changes as changes.  In other similar situations where we consider the volume of a box, tank, or other three-dimensional container, polynomial functions frequently arise. To develop a model function that represents a physical situation, we almost always begin by drawing one or more diagrams of the situation and then introduce one or more variables to represent quantities that are changing. From there, we explore relationships that are present and work to express one of the quantities in terms of the other(s).    A piece of cardboard that is (each measured in inches) is being made into a box without a top. To do so, squares are cut from each corner of the cardboard and the remaining sides are folded up.     Let be the side length of the squares being cut from the corners of the cardboard. Draw a labeled diagram that shows the given information and the variable being used.    Determine a formula for the function whose output is the volume of the box that results from a square of size being cut from each corner of the cardboard.    What familiar kind of function is ?    If we start with a small positive value for and let that value get larger and larger, what is the first value of we encounter that makes it impossible to remove squares from the cardboard and still form a box?    What are the zeros of ? What is the domain of the model in the context of the rectangular box?         Volume, surface area, and constraints  In Preview Activity , we worked with a rectangular box being built by folding cardboard. One of the key principles we needed to use was the fact that the volume of a rectangular box of length , width , and height is . rectangular box volume  volume box     A rectangular box.     A circular cylinder.     One way to remember the formula for the volume of a rectangular box is area of the base times the height . This principle extends to other three-dimensional shapes that have constant cross-sectional area. For instance, the volume of a circular cylinder with radius and height is  circular cylinder volume  volume cylinder since the area of the base is .  We'll also often consider the surface area of a three-dimensional container. For a rectangular box with side lengths of , , and , its surface area consists of pairs of rectangles: the top and bottom, each of area , the two sides that are the front and back when we look right at the box, each of area , and the remaining two sides of area . Thus the total surface area of the box is . For a circular cylinder, its surface area is the sum of the areas of the top and bottom ( each), plus the area of the sides . If we think of cutting the cylinder vertically and unfurling it, the resulting figure is a rectangle whose dimensions are the height of the cylinder, , by the circumference of the base, . The rectangle's area is therefore , and hence the total surface area of a cylinder is . circular cylinder surface area  surface area cylinder   Each of the volume and surface area equations ( Equation , Equation , Equation , and Equation ) involve only multiplication and addition, and thus have the potential to result in polynomial functions. At present, however, each of these equations involves at least two variables. The inclusion of additional constraints can enable us to use these formulas to generate polynomial functions of a single variable.    According to a shipping company's regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel they transport for their lowest rate may not exceed inches, where by girth we mean the perimeter of one end.   A rectangular parcel with a square end.    Suppose that we want to ship a parcel that has a square end of width and an overall length of , both measured in inches.     Label the provided picture, using for the length of each side of the square end, and for the other edge of the package.    How does the length plus girth of inches result in an equation (often called a constraint equation) that relates and ? Explain, and state the equation.    Solve the equation you found in (b) for one of the variables present.    Hence determine the volume, , of the package as a function of a single variable.    What is the domain of the function in the context of the physical setting of this problem? (Hint: neither nor can equal .)                 Suppose that we want to construct a cylindrical can using square inches of material for the surface of the can. In this context, how does the can's volume depend on the radius we choose?  Let the cylindrical can have base radius and height .     Use the formula for the surface area of a cylinder and the given constraint that the can's surface area is square inches to write an equation that connects the radius and height .    Solve the equation you found in (a) for in terms of .    Recall that the volume of a cylinder is . Use your work in (b) to write as a function of the single variable ; simplify the formula as much as possible.    What is the domain of the function in the context of the physical setting of this problem? (Hint: how does the constraint on surface area provide an upper bound for the value of ? Think about the maximum area that can be allocated to the top and bottom of the can.)                 Other applications of polynomial functions  A different use of polynomial functions arises with Bezier curves . Bezier curves The most common type of Bezier curve used in applications is the cubic Bezier curve, which is a curve given parametrically by a formula of the form , where and . The curve passes through the points and and the points and are called control points . At http:\/\/gvsu.edu\/s\/0zC , you can explore the effects of moving the control points (in gray) and the points on the curve (in black) to generate different curves in the plane, similar to the one shown in Figure .    A cubic Bezier curve with control points in gray.     The letter S in Palatino font, generated by Bezier curves.     The main issue to realize is that the form of the curve depends on a special family of cubic polynomials: . These four cubic polynomials play a key role in graphic design and are used in all sorts of important ways, including in font design, as seen in Figure .  Another important application of polynomial functions is found in how they can be used to approximate the sine and cosine functions.    We understand the theoretical rule behind the function : given an angle in radians, measures the value of the -coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle. For special values of , we have determined the exact value of . For example, . But note that we don't have a formula for . Instead, we use a button on our calculator or command on our computer to find values like . It turns out that a combination of calculus and polynomial functions explains how computers determine values of the sine function.  At http:\/\/gvsu.edu\/s\/0zA , you'll find a Desmos worksheet that has the sine function already defined, along with a sequence of polynomials labeled , , , , . You can see these functions' graphs by clicking on their respective icons.     For what values of does it appear that ?    For what values of does it appear that ?    For what values of does it appear that ?    What overall trend do you observe? How good is the approximation generated by ?    In a new Desmos worksheet, plot the function along with the following functions: and . Based on the patterns with the coefficients in the polynomials approximating and the polynomials and here, conjecture formulas for , , and and plot them. How well can we approximate using polynomials?                 Summary    Polynomials arise naturally in the study of problems involving the volume and surface area of three-dimensional containers such as boxes and cylinders because these formulas fundamentally involve sums and products of variables. For instance, the volume of a cylinder is . In the presence of a surface area constraint that tells us that , it follows that , which is a cubic polynomial.    Polynomial functions can be used to approximate non-polynomial curves and functions in many different ways. One example is found in cubic Bezier curves which use a collection of control points to enable the user to manipulate curves to pass through select points in such a way that the curve first travels in a certain direction. Another example is in the remarkable approximation of non-polynomial functions like the sine function, as given by , where the approximation is good for -values near .        You wish to pack a cardboard box inside a wooden crate. In order to have room for the packing materials, you need to leave a space around the front, back, and sides of the box, and a space around the top and bottom of the box.  If the cardboard box is feet long, feet wide, and feet deep, find a formula in terms of for the amount of packing material, , needed.          SOLUTION Let be the amount of packing material you will need, then where and are the volumes of the crate and box, respectively. We have for the box's volume, . The wooden crate must be ft longer than the cardboard box, so its length is . This gives the required ft clearance between the crate and the front and back of the box. Similarly, the crate's width must be ft greater than the box's width of , and its depth must be 2 ft greater than the box's depth of . We have for the crate's volume Thus, the total amount of packing material will be The formula for is a difference of two third-degree polynomials. The format is not terribly convenient, so we simplify the formula by multiplying the factors for and and gathering like terms. Then for we have         An open-top box is to be constructed from a by rectangular sheet of tin by cutting out squares of equal size at each corner, then folding up the resulting flaps. Let denote the length of the side of each cut-out square. Assume negligible thickness.  (a) Find a formula for the volume, , of the box as a function of .   (b) For what values of does the formula from part (a) make sense in the context of the problem?  (c) On a separate piece of paper, sketch a graph of the volume function.  (d) What, approximately, is the maximum volume of the box?  (include units: )                  SOLUTION (a) (b) Values of for which makes sense are , since if or the volume is negative. If , then you would need to cut out a corner which is larger then the length of each side of the paper. (c) (d) Using a graphing calculator, we find the peak between and to occur at . The maximum volume is .        An open triangular trough, as pictured in Figure is being constructed from aluminum. The trough is to have equilateral triangular ends of side length and a length of . We want the trough to used a fixed square feet of aluminum.   A triangular trough.       What is the area of one of the equilateral triangle ends as a function of ?    Recall that for an object with constant cross-sectional area, its volume is the area of one of those cross-sections times its height (or length). Hence determine a formula for the volume of the trough that depends on and .    Find a formula involving and for the surface area of the trough.    Use the constraint that we have square feet of available aluminum to generate an equation that connects and and hence solve for in terms of .    Use your work in (d) and (b) to express the volume of the trough, , as a function of only.    What is the domain of the function in the context of the situation being modeled? Why?      Exercise Answer   Exercise Solution    A rectangular box is being constructed so that its base is twice as long as it is wide. In addition, the base and top of the box cost $ per square foot while the sides cost $ per square foot. If we only want to spend $ on materials for the box, how can we write the box's volume as a function of a single variable? What is the domain of this volume function? (Hint: first find the box's surface area in terms of two variables, and then find an expression for the cost of the box in terms of those same variables. Use the fact that cost is constrained to solve for one variable in terms of another.)   Exercise Answer   Exercise Solution    Suppose that we want a cylindrical barrel to hold cubic feet of volume. Let the barrel have radius and height , each measured in feet. How can we write the surface area, , of the barrel solely as a function of ?

Likewise, what happens if the height is very small?    Use the fact that volume is fixed at cubic feet to state a constraint equation and solve that equation for in terms of .

Why are rational functions important?      The average rate of change of a function on an interval always involves a ratio. Indeed, for a given function that interests us near , we can investigate its average rate of change on intervals near this value by considering . Suppose, for instance, that meausures the height of a falling ball at time and is given by , which happens to be a polynomial function of degree . For this particular function, its average rate of change on is . Structurally, we observe that is a ratio of the two functions and . Moreover, both the numerator and the denominator of the expression are themselves polynomial functions of the variable . Note that we may be especially interested in what occurs as , as these values will tell us the average velocity of the moving ball on shorter and shorter time intervals starting at . At the same time, is not defined for .  Ratios of polynomial functions arise in several different important circumstances. Sometimes we are interested in what happens when the denominator approaches , which makes the overall ratio undefined. In other situations, we may want to know what happens in the long term and thus consider what happens when the input variable increases without bound.    A drug company This activity is based on p. 457ff in Functions Modeling Change , by Connally et al. estimates that to produce a new drug, it will cost $5 million in startup resources, and that once they reach production, each gram of the drug will cost $2500 to make.     Determine a formula for a function that models the cost of producing grams of the drug. What familiar kind of function is ?    The drug company needs to sell the drug at a price of more than $2500 per gram in order to at least break even. To investigate how they might set prices, they first consider what their average cost per gram is. What is the total cost of producing grams? What is the average cost per gram to produce grams?    What is the total cost of producing grams? What is the average cost per gram to produce grams?    Our computations in (b) and (c) naturally lead us to define the average cost per gram function, , whose output is the average cost of producing grams of the drug. What is a formula for ?    Explain why another formula for is .    What can you say about the long-range behavior of ? What does this behavior mean in the context of the problem?         Long-range behavior of rational functions  The functions and are both examples of rational functions, since each is a ratio of polynomial functions. Formally, we have the following definition.   rational function   A function is rational provided that it is possible to write as the ratio of two polynomials, and . That is, is rational provided that for some polynomial functions and , we have .    Like with polynomial functions, we are interested in such natural questions as   What is the long range behavior of a given rational function?    What is the domain of a given rational function?    How can we determine where a given rational function's value is ?     We begin by focusing on the long-range behavior of rational functions. It's important first to recall our earlier work with power functions of the form where . For such functions, we know that where and that since increases without bound as . The same is true when : . Thus, any time we encounter a quantity such as , this quantity will approach as increases without bound, and this will also occur for any constant numerator. For instance, since times a quantity approaching will still approach as increases.    Consider the rational function .  Observe that the largest power of that's present in is . In addition, because of the dominant terms of in the numerator and in the denominator, both the numerator and denominator of increase without bound as increases without bound. In order to understand the long-range behavior of , we choose to write the function in a different algebraic form.     Note that we can multiply the formula for by the form of given by . Do so, and distribute and simplify as much as possible in both the numerator and denominator to write in a different algebraic form.    Having rewritten , we are in a better position to evaluate . Using our work from (a), we have . What is the exact value of this limit and why?    Next, determine .    Use Desmos to plot on the interval . In addition, plot the horizontal line . What is the meaning of the limits you found in (b) and (c)?                 Let and . Note that both the numerator and denominator of each of these rational functions increases without bound as , and in addition that is the highest order term present in each of and .     Using a similar algebraic approach to our work in Activity , multiply by and hence evaluate . What value do you find?    Plot the function on the interval . What is the graphical meaning of the limit you found in (a)?    Next, use appropriate algebraic work to consider and evaluate . What do you find?    Plot the function on the interval . What is the graphical meaning of the limit you computed in (c)?               We summarize and generalize the results of Activity and Activity as follows.   rational function long-term behavior  The long-term behavior of a rational function  Let and be polynomial functions so that is a rational function. Suppose that has degree with leading term and has degree with leading term for some nonzero constants and . There are three possibilities ( , , and ) that result in three different behaviors of :     if , then the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, and thus , which tells us that is a horizontal asymptote of ;    if , then the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator, and thus , which tells us that (the ratio of the coefficients of the highest order terms in and ) is a horizontal asymptote of ;    if , then the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, and thus , (where the sign of the limit depends on the signs of and ) which tells us that is does not have a horizontal asymptote.     In both situations (a) and (b), the value of is identical to .     The domain of a rational function  Because a rational function can be written in the form for some polynomial functions and , we have to be concerned about the possibility that a rational function's denominator is zero. Since polynomial functions always have their domain as the set of all real numbers, it follows that any rational function is only undefined at points where its denominator is zero.   rational function domain  The domain of a rational function  Let and be polynomial functions so that is a rational function. The domain of is the set of all real numbers except those for which .     Determine the domain of the function .    To find the domain of any rational function, we need to determine where the denominator is zero. The best way to find these values exactly is to factor the denominator. Thus, we observe that . By the Zero Product Property, it follows that the denominator of is zero at , , and . Hence, the domain of is the set of all real numbers except , , and .    We note that when it comes to determining the domain of a rational function, the numerator is irrelevant: all that matters is where the denominator is .    Determine the domain of each of the following functions. In each case, write a sentence to accurately describe the domain.                                                Applications of rational functions  Rational functions arise naturally in the study of the average rate of change of a polynomial function, leading to expressions such as . We will study several subtle issues that correspond to such functions further in Section . For now, we will focus on a different setting in which rational functions play a key role.  In Section , we encountered a class of problems where a key quantity was modeled by a polynomial function. We found that if we considered a container such as a cylinder with fixed surface area, then the volume of the container could be written as a polynomial of a single variable. For instance, if we consider a circular cylinder with surface area square feet, then we know that and therefore . Since the cylinder's volume is , it follows that , which is a polynomial function of .  What happens if we instead fix the volume of the container and ask about how surface area can be written as a function of a single variable?    Suppose we want to construct a circular cylinder that holds cubic feet of volume. How much material does it take to build the container? How can we state the amount of material as a function of a single variable?    Neglecting any scrap, the amount of material it takes to construct the container is its surface area, which we know to be . Because we want the volume to be fixed, this results in a constraint equation that enables us to relate and . In particular, since , it follows that we can solve for and get . Substituting this expression for in the equation for surface area, we find that . Getting a common denominator, we can also write in the form and thus we see that is a rational function of . Because of the physical context of the problem and the fact that the denominator of is , the domain of is the set of all positive real numbers.      Suppose that we want to build an open rectangular box (that is, without a top) that holds cubic feet of volume. If we want one side of the base to be twice as long as the other, how does the amount of material required depend on the shorter side of the base? We investigate this question through the following sequence of prompts.     Draw a labeled picture of the box. Let represent the shorter side of the base and the height of the box. What is the length of the longer side of the base in terms of ?    Use the given volume constraint to write an equation that relates and , and solve the equation for in terms of .    Determine a formula for the surface area, , of the box in terms of and .    Using the constraint equation from (b) together with your work in (c), write surface area, , as a function of the single variable .    What type of function is ? What is its domain?    Plot the function using Desmos . What appears to be the least amount of material that can be used to construct the desired box that holds cubic feet of volume?                 Summary    A rational function is a function whose formula can be written as the ratio of two polynomial functions. For instance, is a rational function.    Two aspects of rational functions are straightforward to determine for any rational function. Given where and are polynomials, the domain of is the set of all real numbers except any values of for which . In addition, we can determine the long-range behavior of by examining the highest order terms in and :   if the degree of is less than the degree of , then has a horizontal asymptote at ;    if the degree of equals the degree of , then has a horizontal asymptote at , where and are the leading coefficients of and respectively;    and if the degree of is greater than the degree of , then does not have a horizontal asymptote.       Two reasons that rational functions are important are that they arise naturally when we consider the average rate of change on an interval whose length varies and when we consider problems that relate the volume and surface area of three-dimensional containers when one of those two quantities is constrained.

  "body": " Key features of rational functions     What does it mean to say that a rational function has a hole at a certain point, and what algebraic structure leads to such behavior?    How do we determine where a rational function has zeros and where it has vertical asymptotes?    What does a sign chart reveal about the behavior of a rational function and how do we develop a sign chart from a given formula?      Because any rational function is the ratio of two polynomial functions, it's natural to ask questions about rational functions similar to those we ask about polynomials. With polynomials, it is often helpful to know where the function's value is zero. In a rational function , we are curious to know where both and where .  Connected to these questions, we want to understand both where a rational function's output value is zero, as well as where the function is undefined. In addition, from the behavior of simple rational power functions such as , we expect that rational functions may not only have horizontal asymptotes (as investigated in Section ), but also vertical asymptotes. At first glance, these questions about zeros and vertical asymptotes of rational functions may appear to be elementary ones whose answers simply depend on where the numerator and denominator of the rational function are zero. But in fact, rational functions often admit very subtle behavior that can escape the human eye and the graph generated by a computer.    Consider the rational function , and let (the numerator of ) and (the denominator of ).      Reasoning algebraically, for what values of is ?    Again reasoning algebraically, for what values of is ?    Define in Desmos , and evaluate the function appropriately to find numerical values for the output of and hence complete the following tables.                                                                                                Why does behave the way it does near ? Explain by describing the behavior of the numerator and denominator.    Why does behave the way it does near ? Explain by describing the behavior of the numerator and denominator.    Why does behave the way it does near ? Explain by describing the behavior of the numerator and denominator.    Plot in Desmos . Is there anything surprising or misleading about the graph that Desmos generates?         When a rational function has a hole  Two important features of any rational function are any zeros and vertical asymptotes the function may have. These aspects of a rational function are closely connected to where the numerator and denominator, respectively, are zero. At the same time, a subtle related issue can lead to radically different behavior. To understand why, we first remind ourselves of a few key facts about fractions that involve . Because we are working with a function, we'll think about fractions whose numerator and denominator are approaching particular values.  If the numerator of a fraction approaches while the denominator approaches a nonzero value, then the overall fraction values will approach zero. For instance, consider the sequence of values . Because the numerator gets closer and closer to and the denominator stays away from , the quotients tend to .  Similarly, if the denominator of a fraction approaches while the numerator approaches a nonzero value, then the overall fraction increases without bound. If we consider the reciprocal values of the sequence above, we see that . Since the denominator gets closer and closer to and the numerator stays away from , the quotients increase without bound.  These two behaviors show how the zeros and vertical asympototes of a rational function arise: where the numerator is zero and the denominator is nonzero, the function will have a zero; and where is zero and is nonzero, the function will have a vertical asymptote. What we must be careful of is the special situation where both the numerator and are simultaneously zero. Indeed, if the numerator and denominator of a fraction both approach , different behavior can arise. For instance, consider the sequence . In this situation, both the numerator and denominator are approaching , but the overall fraction's value is always . This is very different from the two sequences we considered above. In Example , we explore similar behavior in the context of a particular rational function.    Consider the rational function from Preview Activity , whose numerator is and whose denominator is . Explain why the graph of generated by Desmos or another computational device is incorrect, and also identify the locations of any zeros and vertical asymptotes of .    It is helpful with any rational function to factor the numerator and denominator. We note that and . The domain of is thus the set of all real numbers except and , the set of all points where .  Knowing that is not defined at , it is natural to study the graph of near that value. Plotting the function in Desmos , we get a result similar to the one shown in Figure , which appears to show no unusual behavior at , and even that is defined. If we zoom in on that point, as shown in Figure , the technology still fails to visually demonstrate the fact that is not defined. This is because graphing utilities sample functions at a finite number of points and then connect the resulting dots to generate the curve we see.    A plot of .     Zooming in on near .     How the graph of should actually appear near .     We know from our algebraic work with the denominator, , that is not defined at . While the denominator gets closer and closer to as approaches , so does the numerator, since . If we consider values close but not equal to , we see results in Table .   Values of near .                                   In the table, we see that both the numerator and denominator get closer and closer to as gets closer and closer to , but that their quotient appears to be getting closer and closer to . Indeed, we see this behavior in the graph of , though the graphing utility misses the fact that is actually not defined. A precise graph of near should look like the one presented in Figure , where we see an open circle at the point that demonstrates that is not defined, and that does not have a vertical asymptote or zero at .  Finally, we also note that and , so at , has a zero (its numerator is zero and its denominator is not). In addition, and (its denominator is zero and its numerator is not), so has a vertical asymptote at . These features are accurately represented by the original Desmos graph shown in Figure .    In the situation where a rational function is undefined at a point but does not have a vertical asymptote there, we'll say that the graph of the function has a hole . rational function hole In calculus, we use limit notation to identify a hole in a function's graph. Indeed, having shown in Example that the value of gets closer and closer to as gets closer and closer to , we naturally write as a shorthand way to represent the behavior of (similar to how we've written limits involving ). This fact, combined with being undefined, tells us that near the graph approaches a value of but has to have a hole at the point , as shown in Figure . Because we'll encounter similar behavior with other functions, we formally define limit notation as follows.    Let and be finite real numbers, and let be a function defined near , but not necessarily at itself. If we can make the value of as close to the number as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to , then we write and say that the limit of as approaches is .    The key observations regarding zeros, vertical asymptotes, and holes in Example apply to any rational function.   Features of a rational function  Let be a rational function.     If and , then , so has a zero at .    If and , then is undefined and has a vertical asymptote at .    If and and we can show that there is a finite number such that , then is not defined and has a hole at the point . It is possible for both and and for to still have a vertical asymptote at . We explore this possibility further in Exercise .         For each of the following rational functions, state the function's domain and determine the locations of all zeros, vertical asymptotes, and holes. Provide clear justification for your work by discussing the zeros of the numerator and denominator, as well as a table of values of the function near any point where you believe the function has a hole. In addition, state the value of the horizontal asymptote of the function or explain why the function has no such asymptote.                                                Sign charts and finding formulas for rational functions  Just like with polynomial functions, we can use sign charts to describe the behavior of rational functions. The only significant difference for their use in this context is that we not only must include all -values where the rational function , but also all -values at which the function is not defined. This is because it is possible for a rational function to change sign at a point that lies outside its domain, such as when the function has a vertical asymptote.    Construct a sign chart for the function . Then, graph the function and compare the graph and sign chart.    First, we fully factor and identify the -values that are not in its domain. Since , we see that . From the denominator, we observe that is not defined at and since those values make the factors or . Thus, the domain of is the set of all real numbers except and . From the numerator, we see that both and are zeros of since these values make the numerator zero while the denominator is nonzero. We expect that will have a hole at since this -value is not in the domain and it makes both the numerator and denominator . Indeed, computing values of for near suggests that , and thus does not change sign at .  Thus, we have three different -values to place on the sign chart: , , and . We now analyze the sign of each of the factors in on the various intervals. For , , , , and . Thus, for , the sign of is since there are an even number of negative terms in the quotient.  On the interval , , , , and . Thus, for these -values, the sign of is .  Using similar reasoning, we can complete the sign chart shown in Figure . A plot of the function , as seen in Figure , shows behavior that matches the sign function, as well as the need to manually identify the hole at , which is missed by the graphing software.    The sign chart for .     A plot of .     In both the sign chart and the figure, we see that changes sign at each of its zeros, and , and that it does not change as it passes by its vertical asymptote at . The reason doesn't change sign at the asympotote is because of the repeated factor of which is always positive.    To find a formula for a rational function with certain properties, we can reason in ways that are similar to our work with polynomials. Since the rational function must have a polynomial expression in both the numerator and denominator, by thinking about where the numerator and denominator must be zero, we can often generate a formula whose graph will satisfy the desired properties.    Find a formula for a rational function that meets the stated criteria as given by words, a sign chart, or graph. Write several sentences to justify why your formula matches the specifications.     A rational function such that has a vertical asymptote at , a zero at , a hole at , and a horizontal asymptote of .

A rational function that has exactly two holes, two vertical asymptotes, two zeros, and a horizontal asymptote.                 Summary    If a rational function has the properties that and and , then has a hole at the point . This behavior can occur when there is a matching factor of in both and .    For a rational function , we determine where the function has zeros and where it has vertical asymptotes by considering where the numerator and denominator are . In particular, if and , then , so has a zero at . And if and , then is undefined and has a vertical asymptote at .    By writing a rational function's numerator in factored form, we can generate a sign chart for the function that takes into account all of the zeros and vertical asymptotes of the function, which are the only points where the function can possibly change sign. By testing -values in various intervals between zeros and\/or vertical asymptotes, we can determine where the rational function is positive and where the function is negative.        The graph below is a vertical and\/or horizontal shift of (assume no reflections or compression\/expansions have been applied).   (a) The graph's equation can be written in the form for constants and . Based on the graph above, find the values for and .   and   (b) Now take your formula from part (a) and write it as the ratio of two linear polynomials of the form, for constants , , and .

Thus, is a choice for a formula. (b) The equation (c) We see that the graph has both an -and -intercept. If then , so . The -intercept is . When , so the -intercept is .

Since the graph has a zero at , let the numerator be . Since the long-run behavior tends toward as , the ratio of the leading terms should be . So a possible formula is . You can check that the -intercept is , as it should be.        Find a possible formula for the function graphed below.

Now, using the formula for we get and solving for yields Now replacing by , we have our formula,         Let be the time in weeks. At time , organic waste is dumped into a pond. The oxygen level in the pond at time is given by  .  Assume is the normal level of oxygen.  (a) On a separate piece of paper, graph this function.  (b) What will happen to the oxygen level in the lake as time goes on?    Choose One    The oxygen level will continue to decrease in the long-run.    The oxygen level will continue to increase in the long-run.    The oxygen level will eventually return to its normal level in the long-run.    It cannot determine based on the given information.    (c) Approximately how many weeks must pass before the oxygen level returns to % of its normal level?  weeks (Round to at least two decimal places.)             SOLUTION (a) A graph of for and is shown in the figure below: At the oxygen is at its normal level in the pond. The level decreases sharply for the first week after the waste is dumped into the pond. The oxygen level reaches its minimum of approximately one half the normal level by the end of the first week. Then the level begins to increase. (b) Eventually, the oxygen level in the pond will once again approach the normal level of one. This is visualized by the gray horizontal asymptote in the graph above. (c) The line is shown in figure above. After the level has reached its minimum, we can approximate the intersection of and at . Thus, it takes about weeks for the level to return to % normal.

SOLUTION (a) A graph of for and is shown in the figure below: At the oxygen is at its normal level in the pond. The level decreases sharply for the first week after the waste is dumped into the pond. The oxygen level reaches its minimum of approximately one half the normal level by the end of the first week. Then the level begins to increase. (b) Eventually, the oxygen level in the pond will once again approach the normal level of one. This is visualized by the gray horizontal asymptote in the graph above. (c) The line is shown in figure above. After the level has reached its minimum, we can approximate the intersection of and at . Thus, it takes about weeks for the level to return to % normal.     "
